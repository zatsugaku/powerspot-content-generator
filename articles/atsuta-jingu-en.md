# Atsuta Jingu Shrine | Complete Guide to Aichi's Sacred Power Spot【Three Imperial Regalia, Access & Area Info】

In the heart of Nagoya lies a sacred forest spanning 190,000 square meters. Atsuta Jingu Shrine enshrines one of Japan's Three Imperial Regalia—the legendary Kusanagi no Mitsurugi (Grass-Cutting Sword)—making it one of the nation's most revered and powerful spiritual sites. With a history spanning over 1,900 years, this shrine commands a level of veneration second only to Ise Grand Shrine.

Upon entering the shrine grounds, the city noise vanishes as if by magic. Ancient camphor trees, some over 1,000 years old, tower overhead, while approximately 6,000 trees create a primeval forest atmosphere in the middle of metropolitan Nagoya. Walking along the approach, surrounded by deep green, visitors naturally feel their minds and bodies being purified.

This is where the legendary warlord Oda Nobunaga prayed for victory before the Battle of Okehazama in 1560—and won against overwhelming odds. That same powerful energy continues to draw approximately 6.5 million visitors annually, seeking blessings for success, protection, and new beginnings.

## The Allure of This Sacred Site

### History and Origins

Atsuta Jingu's founding dates to 113 AD during the reign of Emperor Keiko. According to legend, when Prince Yamato Takeru died on his return journey from his eastern campaigns, his consort Princess Miyasuhime enshrined the sacred Kusanagi sword at Atsuta.

The Kusanagi no Mitsurugi, also known as Ama-no-Murakumo-no-Tsurugi (Sword of the Gathering Clouds of Heaven), is one of the Three Imperial Regalia alongside the Yata Mirror and Yasakani Jewel. These sacred treasures, bestowed by the Sun Goddess Amaterasu, symbolize the legitimate succession of Japan's imperial throne.

In 1560, Oda Nobunaga prayed at Atsuta Jingu before the Battle of Okehazama. With merely 3,000 soldiers, he achieved a miraculous victory over Imagawa Yoshimoto's army of 25,000. In gratitude, Nobunaga donated the "Nobunaga-bei" (Nobunaga Wall), which still stands in the shrine grounds as one of Japan's three great earthen walls.

### Architecture and Natural Features

The main sanctuary's architecture follows the distinctive "Owari-zukuri" style—a graceful combination of gabled roof with a Chinese-style curved gable unique to this region. The current buildings, reconstructed in 1955, faithfully preserve the solemn atmosphere of ancient design.

The shrine grounds contain approximately 6,000 trees, creating a forest-like atmosphere. The most famous is the "Great Camphor Tree" (Okusu), estimated to be over 1,000 years old with a trunk circumference of about 7.7 meters. Tradition holds it was planted by the great monk Kobo Daishi himself. Touching this tree is said to impart its powerful life force.

The Treasure Hall houses approximately 4,000 artifacts, including National Treasures and Important Cultural Properties. Its collection of swords and blades is among the finest in Japan.

### What Makes This Spot Special

Atsuta Jingu's most distinctive blessing is for "victory" and "career success." As the Okehazama story demonstrates, this shrine is believed to grant powerful energy when facing crucial challenges.

As a shrine housing one of the Three Imperial Regalia, Atsuta possesses exceptionally strong "purification" and "renewal" energy. Those feeling exhausted in mind and body, or seeking a fresh start, often experience profound reset effects after visiting.

The "Atsuta Matsuri" festival on June 5th attracts approximately 250,000 visitors, making it Nagoya's largest celebration. About 1,000 fireworks illuminate the night sky while the grounds glow with dedicated lanterns.

## Spiritual Benefits and Effects

### Known Spiritual Benefits

Atsuta Jingu's main deity is Atsuta Okami, considered identical to Amaterasu Omikami, the Sun Goddess. The shrine offers various blessings:

**National Peace and World Harmony**: As guardian of the Imperial Regalia
**Protection and Good Fortune**: Powerful purifying energy
**Victory and Success**: Linked to Oda Nobunaga's legacy
**Family Safety**: Prayers for family happiness and protection
**Business Prosperity**: For entrepreneurs and business success
**Matchmaking**: Available at the Bekku Hachikengu sub-shrine

### The Unique Energy of This Site

Atsuta Jingu is said to contain energy that "strengthens decision-making power." Drawing on the Kusanagi sword's power to "cut through," the shrine helps visitors break through difficult situations and forge new paths.

Because it enshrines a "sword" among the Three Regalia, Atsuta is also believed to possess strong power to "sever negative connections." It's recommended for those wishing to break free from bad habits or unhealthy relationships.
