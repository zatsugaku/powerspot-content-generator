# Shikina-gu Shrine | Complete Guide to Okinawa's Sacred Power Spot【Ryukyu Eight Shrines, Fertility Blessings, Access & Area Info】

Perched on a hilltop in Naha City, Shikina-gu is one of the prestigious "Ryukyu Eight Shrines" (Ryukyu Hassha) dating back to the Ryukyu Kingdom era. Legend holds it was founded following the successful prayer for a prince's birth by King Sho Seni, son of King Sho En who established the Second Sho Dynasty, giving the shrine approximately 500 years of history.

Adjacent to the World Heritage Site "Shikinaen Garden," this shrine harmoniously blends lush green grounds with Okinawa's distinctive red-tiled shrine buildings. Known for blessings of fertility, safe childbirth, and matchmaking, locals affectionately call it "Shichinanu Udun."

About 15 minutes by car from central Naha, it's conveniently located for combining with visits to Shuri Castle and Shikinaen Garden. Won't you experience Okinawa's unique spiritual power at this sacred site where Ryukyuan deities dwell?

## The Allure of This Sacred Site

### History and Origins

Shikina-gu's founding dates to the early 16th century during King Sho Shin's reign. When King Sho Seni, third prince of King Sho En who founded the Second Sho Dynasty, was troubled by not being blessed with children, he prayed at the cave in Shikina where a deity was enshrined. A prince was subsequently born, and in gratitude for this divine blessing, shrine buildings were constructed—marking the shrine's beginning.

The principal deities are the Kumano Gongen (Izanami-no-Mikoto, Hayatama-no-O-no-Mikoto, and Kotosaka-no-O-no-Mikoto). During the Ryukyu Kingdom era, Kumano worship spread to Okinawa, and shrines enshrining Kumano Gongen were established throughout the islands. Among these, Shikina-gu had particularly strong ties to the royal family and received national patronage as one of the "Ryukyu Eight Shrines."

The Ryukyu Eight Shrines refers to eight shrines that the Ryukyu Kingdom specially revered: Naminoue Shrine, Okinomiya, Shikina-gu, Sueyoshi Shrine, Asato Hachimangu, Futenma Shrine, Ameku Shrine, and Kin-gu. Faith continued even after the abolition of the feudal domain system in the Meiji era, and they remain spiritual anchors for Okinawan people to this day.

### Architecture and Natural Features

Shikina-gu's shrine buildings are characterized by Okinawa's distinctive red tiles and white plaster walls. The main hall is wooden construction, inheriting shrine architectural traditions while incorporating Ryukyuan building styles. Though destroyed in the Battle of Okinawa during World War II, it was rebuilt in 1968.

Within the grounds is a spring called "Shikina-no-I" (Shikina Well). This well has been revered as sacred water since ancient times, and worshippers can be seen drawing and taking water home. With abundant water flow, it has nourished people's lives since the Ryukyu Kingdom era.

Behind the main hall lies a limestone cave called "Shikina-do," considered the sacred birthplace of Shikina-gu. While currently off-limits, many people offer prayers near the cave entrance. The surroundings are enveloped in subtropical trees, with distinctly Okinawan vegetation like banyan trees and coral trees flourishing.

### What Makes This Spot Special

Shikina-gu's greatest distinction is its particularly strong reputation for fertility and safe childbirth blessings. Given that its founding stems from a successful prayer for a prince's birth, worshippers seeking children have visited continuously since ancient times. Within the grounds is a "Fertility Stone" (Kosazuke-ishi)—rubbing this stone is believed to bring blessings of children.

Its adjacency to the World Heritage Site "Shikinaen Garden" is another major attraction. Shikinaen was a royal villa of the Ryukyu royal family, featuring beautiful gardens incorporating Chinese garden styles. Visiting together with Shikina-gu worship allows experiencing both Ryukyu Kingdom culture and faith.

During the annual festival held in the ninth lunar month, Ryukyuan dances and traditional martial arts are dedicated, offering opportunities to experience Okinawa's traditional culture.

### The Unique Energy of This Site

Shikina-gu is a place filled with energies of "birth" and "new beginnings." As evidenced by its strong fertility blessings, it is said to have power that supports new life, new paths in life, and new challenges.

Shikina-do (the limestone cave) in particular is considered the source of energy welling up from the earth, and offering prayers nearby is said to make wishes more likely to come true. The sacred water of Shikina-no-I is believed to have the power to purify the body and refresh both mind and body.

Many worshippers report feeling the distinctive "ki" (energy) unique to Okinawan sacred sites, making this known as a place offering spiritual experiences different from mainland Japanese shrines.

### Visitor Testimonials

"I visited when we had been married 5 years and struggling to have children. After rubbing the fertility stone and praying from my heart, we were blessed with a child within that year. Now I come every year to give thanks." (Woman in her 30s, Naha City)

"When I was uncertain about a job change, a friend recommended visiting. In the quietness of the grounds, I had time to face myself and made my decision. Okinawan shrines have a different atmosphere from the mainland—it cleanses the heart." (Man in his 40s, Tokyo)
