# Matsushima | Complete Guide to Miyagi's Scenic Power Spot【One of Japan's Three Most Beautiful Views, Access & Area Info】

As morning mist rises over Matsushima Bay, more than 260 islands emerge from the water like a mystical painting come to life. This breathtaking scenery, celebrated as one of Japan's Three Most Beautiful Views (Nihon Sankei), has captivated visitors for over a millennium.

Matsushima is far more than a scenic destination—it is a profound spiritual site where nature and faith have harmonized for 1,200 years. The area is home to historic temples including Zuiganji, Godaido, and Entsuuin, each carrying centuries of prayers and traditions. The islands themselves are believed to form a natural "barrier" that protects the bay's sacred energy.

Visitors often describe feeling an overwhelming sense of peace and renewal upon seeing Matsushima's panoramic beauty. The famous haiku poet Matsuo Basho was so moved by the view that he reportedly could not compose a single verse—the beauty simply transcended words.

## The Allure of This Sacred Site

### History and Origins

Matsushima's spiritual history dates back approximately 1,200 years to the Heian period. In 807, the legendary general Sakanoue no Tamuramaro visited during his military campaigns and was reportedly moved to tears by the scenery. In 828, the Buddhist monk Ennin (Jikaku Daishi) founded Enpukuji Temple, the predecessor to today's Zuiganji, establishing Matsushima as a center of faith.

During the Kamakura period, the regent Hojo Tokiyori praised Matsushima's beauty. In the Muromachi era, the poet Sogi declared it "the finest scenery in Japan." The golden age came during the Edo period when Date Masamune, the powerful lord of Sendai, undertook a massive reconstruction of Zuiganji Temple. He invested five years and employed 1.3 million workers to create the magnificent structures that stand today.

In 1643, the Confucian scholar Hayashi Shunsai officially designated Matsushima as one of Japan's Three Most Beautiful Views, alongside Amanohashidate and Miyajima.

### Architecture and Natural Features

Matsushima Bay contains approximately 260 islands, each covered with pine trees and vegetation, resembling natural bonsai floating on the water. The islands bear poetic names like Niojima (Deva King Island), Kaneshima (Bell Island), and Senganshima (Thousand Kan Island), each with its own legend.

Zuiganji Temple's main hall is designated a National Treasure and represents the pinnacle of Momoyama period architecture. The sliding door paintings decorated with gold leaf and vibrant colors reflect Date Masamune's aesthetic sensibilities and power.

Godaido Hall, the iconic symbol of Matsushima, was originally built in 807 by Sakanoue no Tamuramaro. The current structure, rebuilt by Date Masamune in 1604, is the oldest Momoyama-style building in the Tohoku region and is designated an Important Cultural Property.

### What Makes This Spot Special

The most distinctive feature of Matsushima is the natural "spiritual barrier" formed by its 260 islands. These islands encircle the bay, believed to block negative energies from the open sea while preserving peaceful, purifying energy within.

Remarkably, during the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami, Matsushima's islands absorbed much of the tsunami's force, resulting in significantly less damage compared to neighboring coastal areas. Local residents speak of how "the islands protected us," reinforcing belief in Matsushima's mystical protective power.

The famous story of Matsuo Basho being rendered speechless by Matsushima's beauty during his "Narrow Road to the Deep North" journey speaks to the transcendent nature of this place—a beauty that defies description.

## Spiritual Benefits and Effects

### The Unique Energy of Matsushima

The predominant energy throughout Matsushima is one of "purification" and "renewal." Many visitors report feeling their worries and daily stress naturally dissolving as they gaze upon the bay's island-dotted expanse.

## Best Times to Visit

### Spring (Late March–May)
Cherry blossom season is spectacular. From Saigyo Modoshi no Matsu Park, the view of 260 cherry trees against Matsushima Bay is breathtaking. Peak bloom occurs around mid-April, with temperatures of 15-20°C (59-68°F) making it ideal for sightseeing. Cherry blossom viewing from sightseeing boats is especially popular.
**Recommendation: ★★★★★**

### Summer (June–August)
The Matsushima Lantern Festival and Fireworks in August features approximately 8,000 fireworks illuminating the night sky. Sea breezes keep temperatures comfortable, and boat cruises are refreshing. Weekends in July-August can be crowded; weekday visits are recommended.

### Autumn (September–November)

**Recommendation: ★★★★★**
