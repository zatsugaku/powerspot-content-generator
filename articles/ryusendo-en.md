# Ryusendo Cave | Complete Guide to Iwate's Underground Power Spot【One of Japan's Three Great Limestone Caves, Underground Lakes, Access & Area Info】

Deep beneath the earth in Iwatizumi Town, Iwate Prefecture, lies a mysterious underground world—Ryusendo Cave. Counted among Japan's Three Great Limestone Caves, this cavern captivates visitors with its underground lakes boasting world-class transparency and stalactites formed over hundreds of millions of years, creating a fantastical subterranean realm.

True to its name meaning "Dragon Spring Cave," crystal-clear cobalt blue underground lakes stretch through the cave's depths, reaching a maximum depth of 98 meters. The water temperature remains constant at approximately 10°C (50°F) year-round, creating an otherworldly space where time seems to stand still. Long revered by locals as a "mystical spring," this sacred site continues to draw visitors seeking purification of body and mind and renewed vitality.

## The Allure of This Sacred Site

### History and Origins

The discovery of Ryusendo Cave dates back approximately 1,200 years to the Heian period. Legend tells of a local hunter who stumbled upon this cave while pursuing game, and since then, it has been carefully protected by the local community as a "sacred place where dragons dwell."

Formal academic surveys began in the 1920s. Subsequent explorations revealed new underground lakes and stalactites, leading to the cave's designation as a National Natural Monument in 1938. The currently confirmed total length of the cave extends approximately 4,088 meters, though it's believed to continue much deeper—its full extent remains unexplored.

The name "Ryusendo" derives from the legend of a dragon deity dwelling within the cave. According to local lore, during a severe drought, villagers performed rain-invoking rituals in this cave, and blessed rains immediately began to fall. This tale is still passed down through generations today.

### Architecture and Natural Features

Ryusendo's greatest attraction is undoubtedly its three underground lakes. The first lake reaches a depth of 35 meters, the second 38 meters, and the third an astounding 98 meters. The water transparency measures 41.5 meters—among the highest in the world—so clear that the lake bottom is visible, creating the mesmerizing blue known as "Dragon Blue."

The cave maintains a constant temperature of approximately 10-11°C (50-52°F) year-round, feeling refreshingly cool in summer and surprisingly warm in winter. The stalactites hanging from the ceiling, stalagmites rising from the floor, and curtain-like limestone formations are said to grow just one centimeter every 100 years—natural artworks created over hundreds of millions of years.

The area called "Gekkyuden" (Moon Palace) is particularly remarkable, where pure white stalactites spread across the ceiling like moonlight illuminating the space, capturing the hearts of countless visitors.

### What Makes This Spot Special

What sets Ryusendo apart from other limestone caves is the overwhelming presence of its underground lakes. With unparalleled transparency and depth, these lakes leave viewers speechless with their beauty. The cobalt blue water surface illuminated by lighting appears like a gateway to another world.

The cave also houses the "Ryusen New Cave Science Museum," where visitors can learn about how limestone caves form and the creatures that inhabit them. Exhibits featuring rare cave-dwelling creatures found only here, such as cave freshwater clams, are among the highlights.

Following recovery from typhoon damage in 2016, new lighting equipment was installed, enabling even more fantastical atmospheric presentations.

## Best Times to Visit

### Spring (April–May)
A season of beautiful fresh greenery. The surrounding mountains begin to bud, allowing visits in refreshing air. The Golden Week period is crowded, so mid to late April weekdays are recommended. Since the cave maintains a constant temperature year-round, this is also a great time to enjoy the temperature difference with the outside air.
**Recommendation: ★★★★☆**

### Summer (June–August)
The most popular season. Even on midsummer days exceeding 30°C (86°F) outside, the cave remains at about 10°C (50°F)—natural air conditioning. It bustles with tourists seeking cool relief, with the Obon period in August being particularly crowded. Weekday mornings in July are the best timing.
**Recommendation: ★★★★★**

### Autumn (September–November)
During autumn foliage season, the surrounding mountains are dyed in reds and yellows, allowing visitors to enjoy both cave exploration and leaf viewing. Peak foliage runs from mid-October to early November. Less crowded than summer, this is a hidden gem period for leisurely viewing.
**Recommendation: ★★★★★**

### Winter (December–March)
The fewest tourists, allowing quiet enjoyment of the cave. While temperatures outside are below freezing, the cave feels warm at about 10°C (50°F). However, be cautious of icy roads. Winter tires are essential.
**Recommendation: ★★★☆☆**

### Best Times of Day

**Right After Opening (8:30–9:30 AM)**: The emptiest time slot. Before tour groups arrive, you can have the mystical space to yourself in complete silence.

**Morning (10:00 AM–12:00 PM)**: Group tours begin increasing, but there's still relative space.

**Afternoon (1:00–4:00 PM)**: The busiest period. Lines may form especially on weekends and holidays.

**Near Closing (4:00–5:00 PM)**: Crowds decrease again, allowing calm viewing. Gazing at the underground lakes in the evening quiet is exceptional.
