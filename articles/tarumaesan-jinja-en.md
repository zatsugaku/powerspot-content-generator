# Tarumaesan Jinja Shrine | Complete Guide to Hokkaido's Volcanic Power Spot【Active Volcano Energy, Access & Area Info】

Perched on a plateau 300 meters above sea level overlooking Lake Shikotsu, one of Hokkaido's most powerful spiritual sites awaits. Tarumaesan Jinja Shrine venerates the active volcano Mount Tarumae as its sacred deity, drawing approximately 400,000 visitors annually to this revered sanctuary of the Dooh region.

Upon entering the shrine grounds, visitors are enveloped by pristine mountain air as panoramic views of Lake Shikotsu and Mount Tarumae unfold before them. On clear days, the volcano's distinctive lava dome can be seen releasing wisps of steam, a visceral reminder of the raw natural power that infuses this sacred space.

## The Allure of This Sacred Site

### History and Origins

Tarumaesan Jinja's founding dates to 1875 (Meiji 8), during the early years of Hokkaido's colonization. The settlers developing the Tomakomai region established this shrine to seek protection from the active volcano Mount Tarumae and its potential eruptions.

The principal deity is Oyamatsumi no Kami, the great god of mountains, accompanied by Kukunochi no Kami (god of trees) and Kayanohime no Kami (goddess of fields). Oyamatsumi no Kami is the same deity enshrined at Oyamazumi Shrine in Ehime, the head shrine of mountain worship throughout Japan.

Through the Meiji and Showa periods, the shrine underwent several relocations and reconstructions, settling at its current location in 1936. The present buildings, rebuilt in 1983, feature robust construction designed to withstand Hokkaido's harsh climate.

### Architecture and Natural Features

The shrine buildings follow the shinmei-zukuri style foundation while incorporating distinctively steep roof angles—a regional adaptation to heavy snowfall. The main hall, worship hall, and shrine gate are all constructed from Japanese cypress, welcoming visitors with the pure fragrance of fresh wood.

The grounds encompass approximately 100,000 square meters (about 25 acres) surrounded by virgin forests of Ezo spruce and Sakhalin fir. Walking along the approach, visitors hear wild birds singing and may even encounter Ezo squirrels darting among the trees.

Most remarkable are the views from within the grounds. On clear days, visitors can see Lake Shikotsu, Mount Tarumae, and even the distant Pacific Ocean. The sight of Mount Tarumae illuminated by early morning light is particularly divine, attracting photography enthusiasts from far and wide.

### What Makes This Spot Special

What makes Tarumaesan Jinja exceptional is its veneration of an active volcano as its sacred body. Mount Tarumae is designated a Rank A active volcano by Japan's Meteorological Agency, maintaining ongoing volcanic activity. This energy from a "living mountain" is said to permeate the entire shrine.

As a shrine that has watched over the pioneering history of Hokkaido, Tarumaesan Jinja is believed to possess power that supports "new beginnings" and "overcoming difficulties"—embodying the pioneer spirit. This is why so many people at life's crossroads—those changing careers, starting businesses, or relocating—come here to pray.
