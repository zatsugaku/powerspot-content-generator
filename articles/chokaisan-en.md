# Mount Chokai | Complete Guide to Akita's Sacred Power Spot【Dewa Fuji, Omonoimi Shrine, Access & Area Info】

Rising on the border between Akita and Yamagata Prefectures, Mount Chokai stands at 2,236 meters as Tohoku's second-highest peak. Its beautiful conical shape has earned it the name "Dewa Fuji," and it has been revered as a sacred site of mountain worship since ancient times.

At the summit sits the main hall of Omonoimi Shrine, enshrining Ukanomitama-no-Mikoto, the deity of food and harvests. Despite being an active volcano with a history of eruptions, its mystical presence has captivated people's hearts, and it has gathered over 1,400 years of faith as "the Mountain of the Gods."

The spectacular views unique to this solitary peak facing the Sea of Japan, abundant alpine flora, and spring water sources dotting the mountain base—Mount Chokai offers a special experience to all who seek nature's blessings and sacred energy, not just mountaineers.

## The Allure of This Sacred Site

### History and Origins

Mountain worship at Mount Chokai dates back to 564 AD, the 25th year of Emperor Kinmei's reign. A major eruption occurred that year, and the imperial court bestowed a divine rank upon the mountain deity to pacify it. This is considered the origin of Omonoimi Shrine, and for over 1,400 years it has been revered as a "mountain of national protection."

The principal deity, Omonoimi-no-Okami, is identified with Ukanomitama-no-Mikoto, the deity of food, and is worshipped as a god who brings abundant harvests. Also venerated as a deity with the power to calm eruptions, it holds the highest rank as the Ichinomiya (primary shrine) of Dewa Province.

During the Heian period, it flourished as a sacred site for Shugendo mountain asceticism, with many practitioners aiming for the summit. In the Edo period, pilgrimage associations called "Chokai-ko" were formed throughout the region, spreading faith among common people. Even today, the grand Omonoimi Shrine Festival is held every July.

### Architecture and Natural Features

Mount Chokai is an active volcano that has been erupting for approximately 600,000 years, with the most recent eruption in 1974. The summit area features a lava dome called Shinzan (2,236m), surrounded by outer rim mountains including Shichikoyama (2,229m).

Omonoimi Shrine has a three-shrine structure with the main hall at Shinzan summit, and two Kuchi-no-miya (entrance shrines) at Fukura and Warabioka at the base. The summit main hall is a small shrine built on rocky ground, but the pilgrimage route leading there is filled with sacred atmosphere.

The vegetation is also rich, with different plant zones forming at various elevations. From July to August in particular, approximately 300 species of alpine plants bloom, including Chokai Fusuma (a species endemic to Mount Chokai), day lilies, and Hakusan windflowers. On the mountainside, famous waterfalls and springs created by Mount Chokai's snowmelt can be found, including "Naso-no-Shirataki" and "Mototaki Fukuryusui."

### What Makes This Spot Special

Mount Chokai's greatest appeal is being a solitary peak directly facing the Sea of Japan. From the summit, a 360-degree panorama spreads out, and on clear days you can see as far as Sado Island and the Oga Peninsula. Sunsets over the Sea of Japan are exceptional, and if you stay at a mountain hut, you can enjoy watching the sun melt into the sea and the starry sky overhead.

The phenomenon called "Kage-Chokai" (Shadow Chokai) is also famous. At sunrise, Mount Chokai's shadow appears as a triangular silhouette floating on the Sea of Japan—a mystical sight. Many photographers and climbers visit seeking this precious moment that can only be seen a few times per year.

The spring water sources at the mountain base are also not to be missed. "Mototaki Fukuryusui" is water from rain and snow that fell on Mount Chokai emerging after about 80 years, with a daily volume of 50,000 tons. The way it flows down the rock face across a width of about 30 meters is truly natural art.

## Best Times to Visit

### Spring (May–June)
Hiking trails begin opening from mid-May, but much snow remains and snow gear is required. By June, snowmelt progresses and skunk cabbage and dogtooth violets begin blooming. The spring water spots at the base are beautiful with fresh greenery.
**Recommendation: ★★★☆☆**

### Summer (July–August)
Peak season. After the July 1st mountain opening, alpine flowers reach their best viewing. From mid-July to early August, colonies of Chokai Fusuma and day lilies are beautiful, and the mountain bustles with many climbers. Summit temperatures are around 10-15°C (50-59°F). The Omonoimi Shrine Grand Festival is held in July.
**Recommendation: ★★★★★**

### Autumn (September–October)
Autumn colors begin in late September, with rowan trees and Erman's birch turning vivid colors. Peak viewing is in early October, when the mountainside becomes a patchwork of red, yellow, and green. After mid-October, there's possibility of snowfall, so proper equipment is needed.
**Recommendation: ★★★★★**

### Winter (November–April)
Entry is difficult for general climbers due to snow cover. Worship at the Kuchi-no-miya shrines (Fukura, Warabioka) at the base is possible. Viewing the snow-covered Mount Chokai from afar is beautiful, but winter climbing is for veterans only.
**Recommendation: ★★☆☆☆**

### Best Times of Day

**Sunrise (4:00-5:00 AM)**: With mountain hut accommodation to summit. The sun rising from the Sea of Japan and Shadow Chokai will become lifetime memories.

**Early Morning (5:00-8:00 AM)**: Few people, allowing quiet climbing and worship in crisp air.

**Daytime (9:00 AM-2:00 PM)**: Peak time with most climbers. Clear visibility allows enjoying views from the summit.

**Evening**: Spectacular sunset over the Sea of Japan. A must-see for those staying at mountain huts.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can beginners climb it?**
A: The Kisakata entrance (Hokotate) route is possible for beginners with good fitness. However, with 1,200m elevation gain and over 10 hours round trip, it's suited for those who exercise regularly. For others, we recommend worship at the base shrines and spring water tours.

**Q: Day trip or mountain hut stay—which is better?**
A: Mountain hut stay is recommended for seeing sunrise or Shadow Chokai. A day trip is also enjoyable but requires early morning departure.

**Q: Can I receive goshuin at the summit Omonoimi Shrine?**
A: Only during summer (around July-September) at the summit main hall. Other times, available at Fukura Kuchi-no-miya or Warabioka Kuchi-no-miya.

**Q: Is snow field walking required?**
A: Depends on route and timing. Kisakata entrance route has almost no snow fields after July. Yashima entrance route has snow fields even in August. Check latest information about crampon necessity.

**Q: Can I enjoy just the base area?**
A: Yes. There are many spots to feel Mount Chokai's power without climbing, including Mototaki Fukuryusui, Naso-no-Shirataki Falls, and Nakajimadai Forest. Combine with worship at the entrance shrines.
