## Highlights and Attractions

### Guardian of Tosa for 1,400 Years

Tosa Shrine was founded during the reign of Emperor Yuryaku (late 5th century) and has been revered as the chief shrine of Tosa Province. The enshrined deities are Ajisukitakahikone-no-kami and Hitokoto-nushi-no-kami. Ajisukitakahikone-no-kami, a son of Okuninushi-no-mikoto, is known for blessings related to agriculture, industrial development, and protection from lightning. Hitokoto-nushi-no-kami is worshipped as a deity who grants wishes "with a single word."

Listed in the Engishiki Jinmyocho (ancient shrine registry), Tosa Shrine holds the prestigious rank of Ichinomiya of Tosa Province. During the Warring States period, Chosokabe Motochika rebuilt the shrine buildings, and subsequent lords of the Tosa Domain, including Yamauchi Kazutoyo, continued to venerate it. The current main hall, offering hall, and worship hall were rebuilt by Chosokabe Motochika in 1587 and are all designated as Important Cultural Properties of Japan.

### Japan's Only "Iri-Tombo-Shiki" Architecture

The most distinctive feature of Tosa Shrine is its architectural style. The "Iri-tombo-shiki" (entering dragonfly style) is a unique structure found only at this shrine, where the worship hall connects to the main hall like a dragonfly diving forward.

Dragonflies were favored by samurai as "victorious insects" (kachi-mushi) because they only fly forward, never backward. It's believed that the warlord Chosokabe Motochika adopted this style with prayers for victory embedded in its design. The cypress bark roof of the main hall draws beautiful curves, and its dignified presence, having weathered over 400 years of elements, deeply moves all who visit.

### Sacred Forest of Ancient Giants

The shrine grounds are home to numerous giant trees, including a sacred camphor tree over 400 years old. Of particular note is the mysterious "Tsubute Stone" (throwing stone). This conglomerate rock is said to have been formed when stones thrown by Empress Jingu during her expedition to the Three Korean Kingdoms fell here.

The approach from "Shinko-mon Gate" to the main hall is a mystical space flanked by towering trees on both sides. On early mornings when mist rises, sunlight filters through the canopy in an almost divine display, making visitors feel as if they've wandered into another world. In the silence of the precincts, only birdsong and the sound of footsteps on gravel can be heard—a truly luxurious moment of peace.

## Spiritual Benefits

### Fortune and Business Prosperity

Ajisukitakahikone-no-kami, the enshrined deity, is known as a god governing agriculture and industry. Consequently, an endless stream of visitors come to pray for business success, commercial prosperity, and bountiful harvests. Merchants of Tosa have long prayed at this shrine for business success, and many have achieved great prosperity.

### Granting Wishes with a Single Word

Hitokoto-nushi-no-kami is known as the deity who "grants wishes with a single word." It's said that rather than complex requests, simple and clear wishes allow you to receive the maximum divine blessing. Try visiting with a single-word wish in your heart—"success," "health," or "good fortune."

### Protection from Misfortune

Ajisukitakahikone-no-kami, with divine powers of protection from lightning, is also believed to have the power to guard against disasters. Many visitors come for yakuyoke (purification from bad luck during unlucky years) and hoiyoke (protection when moving or building a new home), reflecting the deep-rooted faith among the people of Tosa.

### Visitor Testimonials

"I visited when I decided to change careers. I made just one simple wish to Hitokoto-nushi-no-kami for 'good connections,' and the very next month, I received an offer from my ideal company." (40s, Male, Kochi City)

"The moment I entered the grounds, I felt the air change. After praying, my mind felt strangely clear, and what had been troubling me seemed trivial." (30s, Female, Osaka)

## Best Times to Visit

### Spring (March-May) ★★★★★

Late March to early April, when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom, is one of the most beautiful seasons. About 100 Somei-Yoshino cherry trees burst into flower, creating a stunning contrast with the Important Cultural Property buildings. The regular festival is held in April, offering a chance to observe sacred rituals. The mild climate makes this the ideal season for worship.

### Summer (June-August) ★★★★☆

The "Shinane Festival" held on August 24th and 25th is one of Tosa's three great festivals. "Shinane" means "festival of the rice deity," an important ritual praying for abundant harvests. Many visitors from both within and outside the prefecture come during this period, so be prepared for crowds. The summer grounds are surprisingly cool thanks to abundant shade from the trees.

### Autumn (September-November) ★★★★★

Mid to late November, when the camphor and ginkgo trees begin to change color, is highly recommended. Tourist numbers are relatively low, allowing for peaceful worship. On clear autumn days, the contrast between the blue sky and shrine buildings is beautiful, perfect for photography.

### Winter (December-February) ★★★★☆

While New Year's visits bring many worshippers, the quiet returns after mid-January. Thanks to Kochi's mild climate, even mid-winter is relatively comfortable, and worship in the crisp air brings a sense of clarity and focus.
