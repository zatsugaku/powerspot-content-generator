# Kinkengu Shrine | Complete Guide to Ishikawa's Wealth Power Spot【Financial Fortune, Access & Area Info】

Nestled in the mountains of Hakusan City, Ishikawa Prefecture, Kinkengu Shrine stands as one of Japan's most revered sanctuaries for wealth and financial fortune. With a history spanning over 2,100 years, this hidden gem has quietly attracted Japan's top business leaders, including legendary entrepreneurs like Masayoshi Son of SoftBank and Tadashi Yanai of Uniqlo, who have reportedly made pilgrimages here seeking blessings for success.

Founded in 95 BCE during the reign of Emperor Sujin, Kinkengu enshrines Ninigi-no-Mikoto—the grandson of the Sun Goddess Amaterasu who descended from the heavens to rule the mortal realm. The shrine's name, meaning "Golden Sword Palace," evokes the divine blade carried during this celestial descent. As you step through the ancient torii gate and ascend the moss-covered stone steps, you'll understand why this place is considered one of Japan's Three Great Shrines for Financial Fortune.

Unlike commercialized tourist destinations, Kinkengu maintains an atmosphere of profound tranquility. The 800-year-old sacred cedar tree, the 108 stone steps representing Buddhist earthly desires, and the mysterious Otsurugisha sub-shrine—said to be the true source of wealth blessings—create an experience that feels genuinely transformative.

## The Allure of This Sacred Site

### History and Origins

Kinkengu's founding dates to 95 BCE, making it the oldest shrine in the Hokuriku region. Emperor Sujin established it to pray for the development and prosperity of the northern territories. The name "Kinken" (Golden Sword) is believed to derive from the legendary Ama-no-Murakumo-no-Tsurugi (Sword of the Gathering Clouds of Heaven), one of Japan's Three Imperial Regalia.

During the Heian period (794-1185), the shrine became intertwined with the Hakusan mountain worship tradition and flourished as a center for Shugendo mountain asceticism. Though the Kaga Ikko-ikki uprising during the Warring States period caused temporary decline, the powerful Maeda clan of Kaga Domain restored the shrine during the Edo period. The current main hall, reconstructed in 1661, showcases exquisite carvings by master craftsmen of the Maeda domain.

Through the Meiji-era separation of Buddhism and Shinto, Kinkengu emerged in its present form—a shrine that has commanded devotion for over two millennia, testament to its enduring spiritual power.

### Architecture and Natural Features

The main hall exemplifies the elegant "nagare-zukuri" (flowing style) architecture, featuring a gracefully curved cypress bark roof. The worship hall's entrance displays intricate dragon and lion carvings, demonstrating the exceptional craftsmanship of Kaga domain artisans.

The most striking feature is the sacred cedar tree, estimated to be over 800 years old. With a trunk circumference of approximately 7 meters and towering 40 meters high, this majestic giant seems to pierce the heavens. Visitors report feeling a sense of calm and renewed energy when touching or standing near this ancient tree.

The approach extends about 300 meters through a cedar forest, with 108 moss-covered stone steps—the same number as Buddhist earthly desires, suggesting that climbing them purifies the soul. Early morning visits, when sunlight filters through the canopy, offer particularly mystical atmospheres.

### What Makes This Spot Special

Kinkengu's distinguishing characteristic is its specialization in wealth and financial fortune. The name "Golden Sword" itself suggests abundance, and the shrine is counted among Japan's Three Great Shrines for Financial Fortune.

The most important destination within the grounds is "Otsurugisha"—a small sub-shrine located behind the main hall. This unassuming structure is considered the true source of wealth blessings, and those seeking financial success make it their priority. Word-of-mouth among business leaders has spread stories of ventures taking off after praying here, drawing entrepreneurs and investors from across Japan.

The shrine also observes "Tsukinami-sai" (monthly festivals) on the 1st and 15th of each month, considered especially auspicious times for worship. Local tradition of "Tsuitachi-mairi" (first-day worship) remains strong in the community.

## Spiritual Benefits and Effects

### Known Spiritual Benefits

Kinkengu enshrines three deities: Ninigi-no-Mikoto, Okuninushi-no-Kami, and Oyamakui-no-Kami. Each deity offers distinct blessings:

**Wealth and Financial Fortune**: The shrine's most famous benefit. Business success, commercial prosperity, investment luck—all financial wishes are said to find powerful response here.

**Abundant Harvest**: Okuninushi-no-Kami serves as an agricultural deity, and many pray for bountiful crops.

**Matchmaking and Marital Harmony**: As the same deity enshrined at Izumo Taisha, Okuninushi also offers blessings for romantic connections.

**Protection from Misfortune**: The sword power of Ninigi-no-Mikoto is believed to cut through disasters and ward off evil.

### The Unique Energy of This Site

Kinkengu is said to harbor energy that "strengthens decision-making ability." The many business leaders who visit may seek not only financial fortune but also support when facing crucial decisions.

The area around Otsurugisha is considered particularly powerful. Sensitive visitors report feeling warmth or tingling sensations in their palms. The recommended practice is to close your eyes quietly and visualize your specific goals clearly.
