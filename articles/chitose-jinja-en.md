# Chitose Shrine | Complete Guide to Hokkaido's Power Spot【Near New Chitose Airport, Matchmaking, Access & Area Info】

Located in the heart of Chitose City, Hokkaido, on a verdant hill leading to Lake Shikotsu, Chitose Shrine (Chitose Jinja) is a venerable shrine with approximately 300 years of history. Just 15 minutes by car from New Chitose Airport, stepping into the shrine grounds instantly envelops visitors in a serene atmosphere.

The enshrined deities are Toyoukehime-no-Okami (goddess of food and agriculture) and Ichichishimahime-no-Mikoto (goddess of beauty and wisdom). Known for blessings of bountiful harvests, business prosperity, and matchmaking, the shrine is particularly famous for its sacred spring water called "Saiwai no Mizu" (Water of Happiness), which many visitors seek for its fortune-bringing powers.

As the shrine that gave this auspiciously named area its name, "Chitose" meaning "thousand years," it is beloved by those praying for longevity, health, and happiness. With exceptional access, it's the perfect power spot to visit at the beginning or end of your Hokkaido trip.

## The Allure of This Sacred Site

### History and Origins

Chitose Shrine's founding dates back to 1723 (Kyoho 8). At that time, this area was called "Shikotsu" (Ainu for "large depression"), but because it sounded like "shi-kotsu" (death bones), and because many cranes flew to the area, the name was changed to "Chitose" (thousand years) from the phrase "cranes live a thousand years." This shrine is said to be the origin of the place name.

Originally a small shrine enshrining Benzaiten, it was relocated to its current location in 1789 (Kansei 1). Later, in 1875 (Meiji 8), it was renamed Chitose Shrine and has been revered as the guardian deity of the region.

From the Meiji to Taisho eras, Chitose developed with the settlement of tondenhei (soldier-farmers), and the shrine played an important role as the spiritual pillar of the community. The current shrine buildings were reconstructed in 1974 (Showa 49), featuring the simple yet powerful style characteristic of Hokkaido shrines.

The enshrined deity Toyoukehime-no-Okami is the same deity worshipped at Ise Grand Shrine's Outer Shrine (Geku), governing food, clothing, and shelter. Ichichishimahime-no-Mikoto is a goddess of beauty and wisdom associated with Benzaiten. These two deities are believed to bring abundance and happiness to worshippers.

### Architecture and Natural Features

Chitose Shrine is situated on a small hill overlooking the Chitose River. Climbing the stone steps of the approach, visitors enter grounds surrounded by yew and oak trees over 100 years old, wrapped in a tranquility unexpected in the middle of a city.

The shrine buildings exemplify typical Hokkaido shrine architecture, with a simple structure based on the shinmei-zukuri style. The practical, sturdy construction is characteristic of shrines adapted to snowy regions. The chigi (forked finials) and katsuogi (decorative logs) of the worship hall against the blue sky evoke the refreshing spirit of Hokkaido.

The most notable feature of the grounds is "Saiwai no Mizu" (Water of Happiness). This sacred spring water, welling up beside the main hall, has been revered as spiritually powerful since ancient times. Said to emerge from underground water veins connected to Lake Shikotsu over decades, it maintains a year-round temperature of about 7°C and remarkable clarity. Many worshippers bring empty bottles to take this water home.

The grounds also feature an ancient yew tree called the "Tree of Happiness," said to bring good fortune to those who touch it.

### What Makes This Spot Special

What sets Chitose Shrine apart from other shrines is undoubtedly its auspicious connection—being the origin of the name "Chitose."

"Chitose" means "thousand years," symbolizing longevity, health, and lasting happiness. By worshipping at this shrine, visitors are believed to partake in this power. Many locals visit for life milestones such as weddings and Shichi-Go-San (children's blessing ceremony).

Its proximity to New Chitose Airport is also a major attraction. Many visitors pray for safe travels and good fortune at the start of their Hokkaido trip, then stop by again on their way back to express gratitude—serving as a "guardian deity of travel."

Many people take "Saiwai no Mizu" home to use for tea or coffee, allowing them to incorporate this power into their daily lives—another reason for its popularity.
