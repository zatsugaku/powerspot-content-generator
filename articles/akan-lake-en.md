# Lake Akan | Complete Guide to Hokkaido's Mystical Power Spot【Marimo, Ainu Culture, Access & Area Info】

In eastern Hokkaido, surrounded by primeval forest, lies the mystical Lake Akan—a caldera lake formed approximately 150,000 years ago through volcanic activity. With a circumference of about 26 kilometers and maximum depth of 45 meters, this lake is world-renowned as the habitat of the nationally designated Special Natural Monument "Marimo" (moss balls), attracting approximately 1.5 million visitors annually to this premier power spot of eastern Hokkaido.

Standing on the lakeshore, the twin peaks of Mount Oakan and Mount Meakan rise majestically as if standing guard over the lake, their divine presence leaving visitors breathless. Particularly in early morning, when the lake surface is shrouded in mist, the scene becomes truly ethereal—and one begins to understand why the Ainu people have long revered this place as "Kamuy-to" (Lake of the Gods).

Here, Ainu culture—where nature itself is worshipped as divine—continues to thrive. The unique power created by the fusion of this spirituality and pristine natural energy heals visitors and awakens new awareness within them.

## The Allure of This Sacred Site

### History and Origins

Lake Akan's creation dates back approximately 150,000 years. Volcanic activity formed a caldera that gradually filled with water, evolving over eons into its present form.

The first inhabitants of this land were the Ainu people. They called Lake Akan "Kamuy-to" (Lake of the Gods) and offered prayers of gratitude and reverence to the gods (Kamuy) dwelling in the lake, surrounding mountains, and forests. Mount Meakan was especially sacred, known as "Fure-betsu" (Red Mountain), believed to house the goddess of fire.

In 1934, the Lake Akan area was designated as part of Akan-Mashu National Park. In 1952, Marimo received designation as a Special Natural Monument, ensuring protection of this globally rare natural treasure.

### Architecture and Natural Features

Lake Akan's most distinctive feature is its exceptional transparency and mystical coloration. The cobalt-blue waters, created by volcanic minerals and pure water flowing from surrounding primeval forests, represent nature's own artistry.

Around the lake stretches virgin forest of centuries-old Ezo spruce and Sakhalin fir, home to diverse wildlife including Ezo deer, red foxes, and white-tailed eagles. This ecological richness is said to be the source of Lake Akan's energy.

The most famous natural miracle here is "Marimo." These spherical moss formations can grow to over 30 centimeters in diameter and exist in such form only in Lake Akan and parts of Iceland—an extremely rare phenomenon. Their round shape has long been considered a symbol of "connections" and "harmony," making them traditional good luck charms.

### What Makes This Spot Special

What makes Lake Akan a special power spot is the fusion of "nature worship" and "Ainu culture."

The Ainu people have believed that "Kamuy" (gods) dwell in all things natural. Lakes, mountains, fire, wind, animals, plants—all are sacred beings, with humans coexisting as part of nature.

This philosophy deeply connects with the modern concept of "power spots." The many visitors who report feeling "watched over by something" or experiencing "purification of the heart" may be sensing the accumulated "ki" of a place where people have offered prayers for thousands of years.

## Spiritual Benefits and Effects

### Known Spiritual Benefits

The following benefits are associated with Lake Akan:

**Matchmaking**: Marimo's round shape symbolizes "circles" (connections), believed to possess power to unite people. The "Marimo charms" sold at the Ainu Kotan are popular as matchmaking amulets.

**Wish Fulfillment**: By offering prayers to the Ainu gods, visitors seek support for their wishes to come true. Time spent quietly praying by the lakeshore is particularly effective for organizing thoughts and clarifying goals.

**Purification and Reset**: The pure air and water of Lake Akan are said to have cleansing effects on mind and body. Many visitors carrying fatigue and stress report feeling "reset" after their visit.

### The Unique Energy of This Site

Lake Akan is said to possess energy of "harmony and balance."

The geography of Mount Oakan (masculine energy) and Mount Meakan (feminine energy) facing each other across the lake symbolizes yin-yang balance. This harmonized energy is believed to restore balance to visitors' minds and bodies.

Additionally, watching Marimo grow slowly over hundreds of years conveys the message "grow steadily without rushing." For those at life's crossroads or feeling impatient, Lake Akan provides important insights.
