# Kamui Kotan | Complete Guide to Hokkaido's Power Spot【Ainu Sacred Site, Rock Formations, Access & Area Info】

Located at the western edge of Asahikawa City, Hokkaido, where the Ishikari River winds through the mountains, lies Kamui Kotan. In the Ainu language, "Kamui Kotan" means "the place where gods dwell," and this land has been revered as a sacred site by the Ainu people since ancient times.

The Ishikari River flows as rapids here, with mysterious rock formations lining both banks. It is said that Ainu people always offered prayers when passing through this area. The "pothole group" at the river bottom was formed over approximately 10,000 years and is designated as a Hokkaido Natural Monument.

Today, the former JR Hakodate Main Line has been converted into a cycling road, allowing visitors to enjoy beautiful scenery throughout the seasons, including cherry blossoms in spring and autumn foliage. As one of Hokkaido's premier power spots, it is a sacred place visited by those seeking purification and renewal of body and mind.

## The Allure of This Sacred Site

### History and Origins

Kamui Kotan's history is intertwined with Ainu spiritual beliefs. As the name "Kamui Kotan" indicates, the Ainu people believed that gods (Kamui) resided in this place.

The sight of the Ishikari River suddenly narrowing at this point and flowing as rapids is truly a display of nature's power. It is said that when Ainu people passed through this treacherous section in their dugout canoes, they always offered prayers for safe passage. There is also a legend that an evil god (Nitne Kamui) lived here and attacked travelers, so people approached this place with reverence and awe.

In the Meiji era, this area became a key point in Hokkaido's development. In 1898 (Meiji 31), the former JR Hakodate Main Line was opened, and Kamui Kotan Station was established. The railway line running through the steep terrain along the Ishikari River represented the pinnacle of civil engineering technology of that time.

In 1969 (Showa 44), Kamui Kotan Station was closed following the opening of a new route, but the station building and platform have been preserved. Today, the former railway track has been developed into the "Asahikawa Cycling Road."

### Architecture and Natural Features

Kamui Kotan's most distinctive feature is the unique gorge scenery created by the Ishikari River. Strange rock formations called "Kamui-iwa" (God Rocks) line both banks, revealing complex geological structures including green tuff and andesite lava.

At the river bottom lies the "Kamui Kotan Pothole Group." These circular holes were carved into the bedrock by river vortices starting approximately 10,000 years ago. The larger ones exceed 2 meters in diameter, and their formation is estimated to have taken thousands to over 10,000 years. They were designated as a Hokkaido Natural Monument in 1938 (Showa 13).

Kamui Ohashi Bridge is a suspension bridge built in 1938, measuring approximately 78 meters in length. The contrast between the red bridge structure, surrounding greenery, and the emerald green of the Ishikari River is beautiful, making it an iconic view of Kamui Kotan.

The former Kamui Kotan Station building is a restoration of the wooden station built in 1901 (Meiji 34). Its retro atmosphere is popular, and steam locomotives (D51, C57, and 9600 types) are also on display.

### What Makes This Spot Special

What sets Kamui Kotan apart from other power spots is its combination of deep history as an "Ainu sacred site" and the mystical landscape created by "nature's fury."

This place, which the Ainu people named "the place where gods dwell," is more than just a scenic spot. The rapids of the Ishikari River carving rock and forming potholes—contemplating the mind-boggling span of time involved helps us realize how small human worries really are.

Additionally, walking along the abandoned railway line offers a nostalgic atmosphere. A place where many people once passed through is now wrapped in silence—experiencing this "flow of time" is said to have a healing effect on the heart.

## Spiritual Benefits and Effects

### Known Spiritual Benefits

While Kamui Kotan is not a shrine or temple but an Ainu sacred site and natural power spot, it is said to offer the following effects:

**Mind-Body Purification & Reset**: The pure flow of the Ishikari River and the sacred air are said to purify body and mind. Particularly effective for those carrying stress and fatigue.

**Renewal & Fresh Start**: Just as the Ainu people offered prayers here and overcame difficulties, this place is believed to give power of renewal to those facing life transitions or challenges.

**Enhanced Decision-Making & Intuition**: In this place where nature's fury and tranquility coexist, the mind becomes clear and intuition is sharpened. Popular with those facing important decisions.

**Warding Off Evil & Protection**: In Ainu legend, this was a place where evil gods resided, but for that very reason, it is also said to have powerful purification and protective powers.

### The Unique Energy of This Site

What many visitors sense at Kamui Kotan is the "overwhelming power of nature" and "tranquility transcending time."

Gazing at the rapids of the Ishikari River, one keenly feels the power of nature that human strength cannot overcome. This experience, conversely, brings a lightness of heart that comes from "letting go of things beyond our control."

Also, standing before potholes that took over 10,000 years to form helps us realize how short human time perception really is. Many report that their daily worries become relativized and their hearts feel lighter.
