# Jozankei Shrine | Complete Guide to Hokkaido's Hot Spring Power Spot【Healing Blessings, Access & Area Info】

Nestled in the heart of Jozankei Onsen—known as "Sapporo's inner parlor"—Jozankei Shrine has stood as the guardian deity of this hot spring village since its founding in 1905. Approximately 30,000 visitors come each year to this special power spot where the blessings of thermal waters meet the spiritual energy of the surrounding mountains.

Surrounded by the scenic beauty of the Toyohira River valley and primeval forests of Yezo spruce and Sakhalin fir, the shrine grounds feel worlds away from Sapporo's city center, despite being just 50 minutes by car. The autumn foliage season from early to mid-October is particularly spectacular, when the fiery reds of Japanese maples create a stunning contrast with the shrine's traditional architecture. The unique practice of "Toji Sanpai"—combining hot spring bathing with shrine worship—has become a beloved Hokkaido tradition for rejuvenating both body and soul.

## The Allure of This Sacred Site

### History and Origins

Jozankei Shrine was established in 1905 as the hot spring village grew and prospered. The shrine was built to honor Jozan Miizumi, the monk who discovered the hot springs, and to express gratitude for the thermal blessings that sustain the community.

The shrine enshrines two principal deities: Okuninushi-no-Kami and Sukunahikona-no-Kami. In Japanese mythology, these two gods worked together to develop the land and are revered as deities of medicine and hot springs—perfectly suited to watch over this thermal resort town.

The current shrine buildings were reconstructed in 1954, with major renovations completed in 2005 to mark the shrine's centennial anniversary. A monument honoring Jozan Miizumi, founder of Jozankei Onsen, stands within the grounds, preserving the history of this hot spring village for future generations.

### Architecture and Natural Features

The shrine architecture follows the Shinmei-zukuri style in accordance with the Hokkaido Shrine Association. The unpainted wooden buildings blend beautifully with the surrounding greenery, while in winter, the snow-covered structures take on a divine beauty. The main hall, worship hall, and purification fountain are all constructed from hinoki cypress, and the fresh woody fragrance creates a refreshing atmosphere for worshippers.

The shrine grounds cover approximately 3,000 square meters, situated along a tributary of the Toyohira River and surrounded by primeval forests of Yezo spruce and Sakhalin fir. Visitors can enjoy cherry blossoms in spring, lush greenery in summer, autumn colors in fall, and snow-covered landscapes in winter. The view of the valley from within the shrine grounds is particularly spectacular and popular among photographers.

The stone stairway approach consists of 108 steps—the same number as the Buddhist concept of earthly desires. Climbing these stairs one by one is said to purify the heart and mind. Moss-covered stone lanterns line both sides of the stairway, creating a mystical experience as you walk through the deep forest.

### What Makes This Spot Special

Jozankei Shrine's greatest distinction is the ability to combine hot spring bathing with shrine worship. According to local tradition, bathing in the onsen after praying at the shrine amplifies the spiritual benefits—a practice known as "Toji Sanpai" that has become uniquely associated with Jozankei.

The shrine grounds also feature spots connected to the local "Kappa legend." Ancient folklore tells of water sprites (kappa) living in Jozankei's waters, and the shrine offers popular amulets and ema (votive tablets) featuring these mythical creatures. The kappa are considered water spirits that symbolize the blessings of the hot springs.

Affectionately called "Jozankei-san" by locals, the shrine's annual Grand Festival in June transforms the entire hot spring village into a celebration of community and tradition.

## Spiritual Benefits and Effects

### Known Spiritual Benefits

Jozankei Shrine offers a wide range of blessings:

**Matchmaking and Romance**: Okuninushi-no-Kami is the same deity enshrined at Izumo Taisha, famous throughout Japan for matchmaking blessings. Many couples visiting the hot springs and singles seeking romantic connections come to pray here.

**Business Prosperity**: As the guardian deity of the hot spring village, the shrine also offers blessings for business success. Local inn and shop owners regularly visit to pray for prosperity.

**Warding Off Evil and Good Fortune**: Climbing the 108 steps of the approach is said to cleanse away misfortune, making this a popular destination for those in their unlucky years (yakudoshi).

### The Unique Energy of This Site

## Best Times to Visit

### Spring (Late April–May)
Spring arrives with the melting snow. Cherry blossoms bloom in early May, creating a uniquely Hokkaido scene against the backdrop of still snow-capped mountains. Temperatures of 10-18°C (50-64°F) are comfortable, and with fewer tourists, this is a hidden gem season. Mid-May when fresh green leaves begin to emerge is especially recommended.
**Recommendation: ★★★★☆**

### Summer (June–August)
The shrine grounds, enveloped in deep green, stay cool—typically 3-5°C (5-9°F) lower than central Sapporo, making it perfect for escaping the heat. The Grand Festival on June 15th is the year's biggest event, featuring portable shrine processions and traditional performances. July and August bring peak tourist season, but early morning visits offer peaceful worship.
**Recommendation: ★★★★☆**

### Autumn (September–October)
The best season for Jozankei Shrine. From early to mid-October, the autumn colors are breathtaking—the brilliant red maples against the shrine architecture create unforgettable views. During the autumn illumination period, evening visits are also possible. Temperatures of 8-15°C (46-59°F) require warm clothing.
**Recommendation: ★★★★★**

### Winter (November–March)
The snow-covered grounds take on a mystical atmosphere. Approximately 5,000 visitors come for New Year's prayers. The Yukiakari (Snow Lantern) event in February illuminates the grounds with candles, creating a magical winter wonderland. Temperatures drop to -5 to -10°C (14-23°F), so proper winter gear is essential. The stairs are cleared of snow but can be slippery.
**Recommendation: ★★★☆☆**

### Best Times of Day

**Early Morning (7:00-9:00 AM)**: Few tourists, allowing you to have the sacred atmosphere to yourself. The grounds shrouded in morning mist are particularly ethereal.

**Morning (9:00 AM-Noon)**: The shrine office is open for amulets and goshuin (shrine stamps). Visiting in the morning followed by lunch in the hot spring village is recommended.

**Late Afternoon (3:00-5:00 PM)**: The shrine buildings bathed in western light are beautiful. During autumn foliage season, this hour offers especially stunning views.
