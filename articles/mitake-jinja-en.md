# Musashi Mitake Shrine | Complete Guide to Tokyo's Mountain Power Spot【Dog Worship, Sacred Forest, Access & Area Info】

Perched atop Mount Mitake (929m) in Ome City, Tokyo, Musashi Mitake Shrine stands as one of the Kanto region's premier power spots with approximately 2,000 years of history. Said to have been founded during the era of Emperor Sujin, this venerable sanctuary has gathered faith since ancient times as a "Sacred Mountain of Kanto." Despite being accessible in about 2 hours from central Tokyo, visitors can experience the deep world of mountain worship here.

The principal deities are Kushimachi-no-Mikoto, Onamuchi-no-Mikoto, Sukunahikona-no-Mikoto, and Yamato Takeru-no-Mikoto. Particularly famous is the legend that during Yamato Takeru's eastern expedition, he was guided by a divine dog "Oinu-sama" of Mount Mitake, making this shrine known as a sacred place for dog lovers. The annual "Dog Blessing Ceremony" draws many pet owners and their beloved dogs from across Japan.

Taking the cable car up the mountain and walking the approach path, visitors are enveloped in a sacred forest where giant trees stand, including the "Jindai Keyaki" zelkova estimated to be approximately 1,000 years old. Upon reaching the summit, magnificent vermillion shrine buildings appear alongside panoramic views of the Kanto Plain. Popular both as a power spot and hiking destination, the shrine offers the unique appeal of worshipping while enjoying nature through the seasons.

## The Allure of This Sacred Site

### History and Origins

Musashi Mitake Shrine's founding is said to date to the era of Emperor Sujin, the 10th emperor (around 97 BCE). The shrine has gathered faith since ancient times as a sacred mountain of Musashi Province, flourishing particularly from the Heian period onward as a holy site for mountain asceticism (Shugendo).

The legend of Yamato Takeru is this shrine's most famous origin story. During his eastern expedition, Yamato Takeru lost his way on Mount Mitake and was guided by a white wolf. This divine dog is enshrined as "Okuchi-no-Makami" (Great Mouth True God) and remains affectionately known as "Oinu-sama" today. Shrines enshrining wolves as deities are rare, making this one of the reasons worshippers visit from across the country.

During the Kamakura period, the shrine received deep reverence from warrior clans, with Hatakeyama Shigetada said to have built the shrine buildings. In the Edo period, faith communities called "Mitake-ko" spread throughout the Kanto region, with many commoners making pilgrimages to Mount Mitake. Even today, approximately 25 lodging houses called "Oshi-no-Ie" remain on the mountain, welcoming worshippers.

Due to the separation of Shinto and Buddhism in the Meiji era, what was formerly "Musashi Mitake Daigongen" became the present "Musashi Mitake Shrine." However, traces of mountain worship remain throughout, preserving the atmosphere of Shugendo asceticism.

### Architecture and Natural Features

Musashi Mitake Shrine's buildings boast magnificent architecture despite being located on a mountain summit. The main hall retains architectural elements from the Muromachi period, while the worship hall was rebuilt during the Kansei era (1789-1801) of the Edo period. The contrast between vermillion shrine buildings and deep green forest leaves a profound impression on visitors.

The most famous feature within the grounds is the "Jindai Keyaki," a zelkova tree estimated to be approximately 1,000 years old. This giant tree with a trunk circumference of about 8.2 meters and height of about 30 meters is designated a Natural Monument of Japan. Located along the approach path, its overwhelming presence seems to welcome worshippers like a guardian.

Mount Mitake stands at 929 meters, with views from the summit extending to the Kanto Plain, Chichibu mountain range, and on clear days to Mount Fuji. Within the mountain lies "Rock Garden," a moss-covered ravine popular as a hiking course along the clear stream. The mountain is also known for its Japanese woodland anemone colony, with approximately 50,000 flowers blooming in August.

### What Makes This Spot Special

Musashi Mitake Shrine's greatest feature is the "Oinu-sama" worship and "Dog Blessing Ceremony." Based on the legend of the divine dog guiding Yamato Takeru, dogs are permitted on the grounds, making this a sacred place for dog lovers. On the second Sunday of each month, a "Dog Blessing Ceremony" is held, drawing pet owners from across the country praying for their pets' health and longevity.

Additionally, approximately 25 "Oshi-no-Ie" (lodging houses) line the mountaintop, allowing visitors to stay overnight while worshipping—another distinctive feature. Oshi were priests connecting shrines with believers, and these lodging houses preserve Mount Mitake's traditional culture dating from the Edo period. Guests can enjoy shojin ryori (Buddhist vegetarian cuisine) while experiencing the atmosphere of mountain worship.

Pilgrimage to the inner shrine is also popular. The inner shrine on Oguna-no-Mine can be reached with about 20 minutes of hiking from the main hall and is known as a place where stronger power can be felt.
