# Seimei Shrine | Complete Guide to Kyoto's Mystical Power Spot【Onmyoji, Evil-Warding, Access & Area Info】

Seimei Shrine, dedicated to Abe no Seimei—the most powerful onmyoji (yin-yang master) of the Heian period—is known as one of Kyoto's premier power spots for warding off evil. Located beside Ichijo Modori Bridge on the site of Seimei's former residence, this shrine attracts approximately 500,000 visitors annually seeking protection from evil and misfortune.

The grounds, featuring the five-pointed star (Seimei Kikyo) as its symbol, are dotted with attractions related to onmyodo (the way of yin and yang), including the "Seimei Well" said to have been made to spring forth by Seimei's spiritual powers, and stone statues of shikigami (spirit servants). With the popularity of Abe no Seimei surging through films, dramas, and manga, the shrine has gained passionate support from younger generations as well.

Conveniently located within walking distance of Kyoto Imperial Palace, it's easy to combine with other tourist attractions. Won't you experience the power of this legendary onmyoji that continues to captivate people across a thousand years?

## The Allure of This Sacred Site

### History and Origins

Seimei Shrine was founded in 1007 (Kanko 4) by order of Emperor Ichijo on the site of Abe no Seimei's residence. Abe no Seimei (921-1005) was an onmyoji active during the mid-Heian period, well-versed in astronomy, calendar science, and divination, serving for many years in the imperial court's Onmyoryo (Bureau of Yin and Yang).

Seimei is surrounded by numerous legends. He is said to have possessed spiritual powers from childhood and could freely control demons and shikigami. Particularly famous are his prediction of Emperor Kazan's abdication through divination, his prayers to dispel epidemics, and his healing of Emperor Ichijo's illness. His mystical powers have been passed down as the "Seimei Legends."

The shrine fell into disrepair during the Onin War (1467-1477) but was restored during the Edo period. In recent years, the hit film "Onmyoji" (2001) and Abe no Seimei's popularity in manga and games have drawn worshippers from across the nation.

### Architecture and Natural Features

At the entrance to Seimei Shrine stands a torii gate displaying the five-pointed star known as the "Seimei Kikyo." This pentagram is considered a symbol of protection against evil in onmyodo and can be seen throughout the grounds.

Upon entering the grounds, visitors first encounter the "First Torii" and "Second Torii." Passing through the Second Torii, stone statues of shikigami—spirit servants said to have been commanded by Seimei—greet visitors. Legend has it that these shikigami normally hid beneath the bridge.

The main hall, while relatively small, exudes a solemn atmosphere. The worship hall displays a portrait of Seimei, whose sharp gaze watches over worshippers. Within the grounds stands a sacred tree approximately 300 years old, with power said to dwell at its roots.

### What Makes This Spot Special

Seimei Shrine's greatest highlight is the "Seimei Well." This well, said to have been made to spring forth by Seimei's spiritual powers, is believed to be particularly efficacious for healing illness. The well's water outlet faces that year's lucky direction (eho) and is changed annually at the beginning of spring (Risshun).

"Ichijo Modori Bridge" is also not to be missed. While the current bridge is a small reconstruction within the grounds, the actual Ichijo Modori Bridge is located approximately 100m south of the shrine. This bridge is legendary as a place where "the dead return to life" and was known as the place where Seimei hid his shikigami.

Additionally, the grounds contain a statue of the yakuyoke (evil-warding) peach. Peaches have been considered to have protective powers against evil since ancient times, and rubbing this statue is said to remove misfortune. It's a popular spot with visitors often forming lines.

### The Unique Energy of This Site

Seimei Shrine is a place filled with energies of "purification" and "protection." The power of Seimei, who has been worshipped as a deity of protection against evil for over a thousand years, is said to dispel negative energy from visitors' bodies and minds, filling them with pure energy.

The five-pointed star (Seimei Kikyo) motif is particularly a powerful symbol of evil-warding. Many worshippers report feeling the air change the moment they enter the grounds. Many voices report feeling lighter when visiting during times of worry or trouble with personal relationships.
