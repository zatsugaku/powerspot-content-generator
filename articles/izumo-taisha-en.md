*A shrine embraced by lush greenery*

In Izumo City, Shimane Prefecture—the mythological heartland of Japan—stands Izumo Taisha (formally read "Izumo Oyashiro," commonly "Izumo Taisha"), one of the nation's most ancient and revered shrines. Its origins are recorded in the Kojiki, Japan's oldest historical chronicle, dating back to the age of myths.

The shrine's most striking feature is its massive shimenawa (sacred rope) at the worship hall—at 13.6 meters long and weighing 5.2 tons, it's among the largest in Japan. The solemn main sanctuary, the vast sacred grounds—Izumo Taisha's majestic atmosphere overwhelms all who visit.

The enshrined deity is Okuninushi-no-Okami (Great Lord of the Land), affectionately known as "Daikoku-sama." Famous for the myth of yielding his land to the heavenly gods, Okuninushi is worshipped nationwide as the supreme deity of "en-musubi" (connection of destinies). Here, "en" doesn't just mean romantic love—it encompasses all meaningful connections: business relationships, friendships, family bonds, and every fortunate encounter in life.

Each October by the lunar calendar, eight million gods from across Japan gather at Izumo Taisha to discuss the fates of mortals. While the rest of Japan calls this month "Kannazuki" (Month Without Gods), Izumo alone calls it "Kamiarizuki" (Month With Gods). During this special period, Izumo Taisha overflows with divine power.

Walking the approach path, standing before the great shimenawa, placing your hands together toward the main sanctuary—many worshippers describe feeling an inexplicable sense of peace and a premonition of meaningful encounters to come.

## Highlights and Attractions

### A Sacred Site Where Japanese Mythology Lives On

![Torii gate and stone lanterns](https://k005.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/pexels-7914822.jpg)
*Traditional torii gate with stone lanterns*

The history of Izumo Taisha stretches back to the age of Japanese mythology. According to the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, when Okuninushi-no-Okami yielded his dominion over the earthly realm to the heavenly gods, they promised to build him a magnificent shrine in recognition of his virtue—this is said to be the origin of Izumo Taisha.

Okuninushi developed the land, taught agriculture and medicine, and worked with numerous other deities to enrich the nation. In the process, he formed countless connections—which is why he came to be revered as the supreme deity of en-musubi (destiny connection).

The most famous myth involving Okuninushi is "The White Hare of Inaba." The kind-hearted deity helped an injured rabbit, and later won the hand of the beautiful Princess Yakami. This tale established Okuninushi's reputation as a deity of romantic success.

Within the shrine grounds, you'll find the "Statue of Divine Compassion" depicting Okuninushi helping the white hare. Many visitors pray here for connection and romance.

### Architecture of Overwhelming Presence

Izumo Taisha's main sanctuary is built in the "Taisha-zukuri" style—Japan's oldest form of shrine architecture. This unique style, found only at Izumo Taisha, has been designated a National Treasure.

The current main sanctuary was constructed in 1744, standing approximately 24 meters tall. However, according to tradition, the ancient Izumo Taisha once soared to 48 meters—some legends claim 96 meters! In the year 2000, massive pillar remains discovered on the grounds proved these legends were no mere fantasy.

The shimenawa at the worship hall measures 13.6 meters long and weighs 5.2 tons—one of Japan's largest. This enormous sacred rope serves as a boundary between the divine realm and the human world. Standing beneath it and looking up, visitors are invariably awestruck.

Particularly noteworthy is the orientation of the deity's seat. While most shrine deities face south, Okuninushi faces west—toward Inasa Beach, the legendary site where he yielded his dominion. This unique arrangement sets Izumo Taisha apart from all other major shrines.

### The Story of Four Torii Gates

![Approach lined with lanterns](https://k005.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/pexels-20593176-1.jpg)
*Stone lanterns line the approach to the shrine*

The formal approach to Izumo Taisha differs from the commonly used entrance. The official path begins at the Ugabashi Grand Torii Gate, about 2 kilometers southeast of the main shrine.

The first torii, Ugabashi Grand Torii, is an enormous reinforced concrete gate standing 23 meters tall. About 1 kilometer beyond lies the second gate, Seidamari Grand Torii. Most visitors begin their pilgrimage here.

From Seidamari Grand Torii, a descending path continues—a rare feature among Japanese shrines. This is because Izumo Taisha is built on gently undulating terrain rather than flat ground.

Continuing down brings you to the third gate, Pine Approach Torii. From here, a 250-meter avenue of centuries-old pine trees creates a majestic pathway. Some of these pines were planted by Emperor Showa, adding to the sacred atmosphere.

After passing through the fourth gate, the Bronze Torii, you enter the sacred precinct containing the worship hall and main sanctuary.

Proper etiquette on the approach is also unique. While most shrines recommend walking down the center, Izumo Taisha recommends the left side. This is because Okuninushi's seat faces west, making the left side the "front" from the visitor's perspective.

### Auxiliary Shrines Throughout the Grounds

![Wooden shrine architecture](https://k005.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/pexels-8050482-1.jpg)
*Exquisite wooden shrine architecture*

The grounds of Izumo Taisha feature numerous auxiliary shrines surrounding the main sanctuary, each enshrining deities connected to Okuninushi. Visiting these shrines offers various additional blessings.

**Soga-no-Yashiro**: Located directly behind the main sanctuary at the foot of Mount Yakumo, this shrine is dedicated to Susanoo-no-Mikoto, considered Okuninushi's divine father. Many believe this is the most powerful spot within Izumo Taisha.

**Uji-no-Yashiro**: Four shrines on the east side of the main sanctuary enshrine Okuninushi's ancestral deities and divine children.

**Jukusha (Nineteen Shrines)**: Long narrow structures flanking the main sanctuary east and west serve as lodging for the gods who gather from across Japan during Kamiarizuki. Their doors remain closed except during this month.

**Kagura-den**: Famous for its massive shimenawa, this building hosts weddings and sacred music performances.

## Spiritual Benefits and Blessings

### Japan's Supreme En-musubi: Connecting All Destinies

Izumo Taisha's most famous blessing is, unquestionably, **en-musubi** (connection of destinies). As the deity who oversees all connections throughout Japan, Okuninushi is believed to possess extraordinary power.

Here, "en-musubi" encompasses far more than romance and marriage. It includes career opportunities, friendships, family relationships, and even connecting with one's own potential—all meaningful encounters in life.

Connections formed at Izumo Taisha are said to be particularly strong. Many couples dream of holding their wedding ceremony at this sacred site.

### Fertility, Safe Childbirth, and Family Harmony

Okuninushi is known for having fathered many children, giving the shrine powerful blessings for **fertility** and **safe delivery**. Many couples hoping to conceive and expecting mothers visit to pray.

The shrine also strengthens family bonds and promotes **household harmony**. Many who struggle with family relationships report feeling lighter after worshipping here.

### Business Prosperity and Abundant Harvests

As a deity of land development, Okuninushi also offers blessings for **business success** and **bountiful harvests**. Farmers and business owners have particular devotion here, and many entrepreneurs visit to pray for their ventures' success.

### General Happiness and Good Fortune

As "Daikoku-sama," Okuninushi brings happiness to people and guides them toward **good fortune** and **positive outcomes**. Many visit Izumo Taisha during life transitions, new beginnings, or before major decisions to seek divine guidance.

### Visitor Experiences

*"Three months after visiting Izumo Taisha, I met someone through a chance encounter. We started dating and married a year later. I'll never forget the strange sense of peace I felt there."* (35-year-old woman from Hiroshima)

*"After struggling with infertility for years, I prayed at Izumo Taisha for a child. Six months later, I was pregnant. I safely delivered a healthy baby."* (38-year-old woman from Tokyo)

*"I visited while contemplating a career change. The moment I placed my hands together before the great shimenawa, I felt a sudden certainty: 'Now is the time.' I changed jobs and now work in what I consider my calling."* (42-year-old man from Osaka)

## Best Times to Visit

### Spring (March-May) ★★★★★

Spring at Izumo Taisha brings beautiful cherry blossoms and fresh greenery in comfortable weather. From late March to early April, cherry trees throughout the grounds reach full bloom. The trees along the Pine Approach are particularly stunning.

Temperatures range from 10-20°C (50-68°F), ideal for worship. However, cherry blossom season and Golden Week bring crowds. Early morning visits on weekdays (7-9 AM) are recommended.

May's fresh greenery season offers crisp, clear air for refreshing mind and body.

### Summer (June-August) ★★★☆☆

The June rainy season sees fewer visitors, allowing for quiet worship. Rainy-day Izumo Taisha has its own charm, with vibrant green colors.

July and August reach around 30°C (86°F), but sea breezes keep conditions relatively comfortable. Early morning (6-8 AM) or late afternoon (after 4 PM) visits are recommended.

Summer vacation brings families, but the spacious grounds absorb crowds well.

### Autumn (September-November) ★★★★★

![Shrine in autumn foliage](https://k005.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/pexels-3322918-2.jpg)
*Autumn colors embrace the shrine*

Autumn is the ideal season for Izumo Taisha worship. In the tenth lunar month, the Kamiari Festival welcomes gods gathering from across Japan (around November by the modern calendar). Special rituals are performed, and divine power is said to reach its peak.

The festival period is crowded, but attending once in a lifetime is worthwhile. You can participate in special ceremonies like the En-musubi Taisai (Grand Festival of Destiny Connection).

October through November brings comfortable temperatures of 15-20°C (59-68°F). On clear autumn days, shrine buildings against blue skies make perfect photographs.

### Winter (December-February) ★★★☆☆

Winter brings fewer visitors and profound tranquility. Temperatures around 5-10°C (41-50°F) occasionally bring snow. Snow-covered grounds create an otherworldly atmosphere.

New Year's hatsumode (first shrine visit) brings large crowds. Avoid January 1-3 if possible; conditions calm down after mid-January.

While cold, worshipping in crisp winter air creates a bracing, mind-clearing experience.

### Recommended Time Slots

**Early Morning (6-8 AM)**: The most quiet, sacred atmosphere. Morning light illuminates the approach, and the air feels cleansing.

**Mid-Morning (8-11 AM)**: Before tour buses arrive. Allows for leisurely worship.

**Midday (11 AM-3 PM)**: Most crowded, especially on weekends and holidays.

**Late Afternoon (3-5 PM)**: Beautiful soft light. Crowds begin to thin.

## Worship Guide

### Izumo Taisha's Unique Worship Protocol

Izumo Taisha has distinctive worship customs different from other shrines.

**Ni-hai, Shi-hakushu, Ichi-hai (Two Bows, Four Claps, One Bow)**

While most shrines use "two bows, two claps, one bow," Izumo Taisha requires four claps. Only Izumo Taisha and Usa Shrine in Oita Prefecture observe this special protocol.

1. **Two Bows**: Bow deeply twice
2. **Four Claps**: Clap your hands four times
3. **Prayer**: With hands together, pray sincerely
4. **One Bow**: Bow deeply once

Why four claps? Various theories exist: representing "shiawase" (happiness, with "shi" meaning four), or symbolizing the four seasons.

### Worship Route

**Start at Seidamari Grand Torii**: The entrance most visitors use. Bow once before entering the grounds.

**Descending Path**: Walk down the gentle slope. Stay on the left side.

**Harae-no-Yashiro**: A small shrine on the left side of the descending path. Properly, you should purify yourself here before proceeding. Many visitors miss this—don't skip it.

**Bronze Torii**: Pass through the fourth gate and the worship hall comes into view.

**Temizuya (Purification Fountain)**: Located before the worship hall. Properly cleanse hands and mouth.

**Worship Hall**: Pay respects at the impressive shimenawa-adorned hall. Use the four-clap protocol.

**Yatsushamon Gate**: Beyond the worship hall, before the main sanctuary. Regular visitors can come no closer than this. Worship once more here.

**Soga-no-Yashiro**: Behind the main sanctuary, at the foot of Mount Yakumo. Said to be Izumo Taisha's most powerful spot. There's a custom of offering sand from Inasa Beach here and taking sacred sand in return.
