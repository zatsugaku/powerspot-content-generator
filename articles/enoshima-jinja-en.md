# Enoshima Shrine | Complete Guide to Kanagawa's Power Spot【Benzaiten, Matchmaking, Access & Area Info】

Located on Enoshima Island, the symbol of Shonan in Fujisawa City, Kanagawa Prefecture, Enoshima Shrine is a venerable shrine known as one of Japan's Three Great Benzaiten. Said to have been founded during the reign of Emperor Kinmei approximately 1,500 years ago, this ancient shrine comprising three sanctuaries—Hetsu-miya, Nakatsu-miya, and Okutsu-miya—draws approximately 1.5 million worshippers annually.

The enshrined deities are three sister goddesses—Tagitsuhime-no-Mikoto, Ichikishimahime-no-Mikoto, and Tagorihime-no-Mikoto. Collectively known as "Enoshima Okami," they are known for blessings particularly appealing to women, including artistic talent enhancement, financial fortune, and matchmaking.

As a sacred site of Benzaiten worship and a power spot for romantic fulfillment, Enoshima Shrine enjoys tremendous popularity among couples and groups of women. The spectacular views overlooking Sagami Bay, historic shrine buildings, and mysterious sea caves—this power spot offers a special experience to all who visit.

## The Allure of This Sacred Site

### History and Origins

Enoshima Shrine's founding is said to date to 552 (13th year of Emperor Kinmei's reign). According to legend, a heavenly maiden descended from heaven and created the island, after which a deity was enshrined.

During the Nara period, many eminent monks including En no Ozunu, Kukai, and Nichiren practiced asceticism here. Particularly during the Kamakura period, Minamoto no Yoritomo prayed here for victory before his campaign against the Oshu Fujiwara clan, and the shrine continued to gather the faith of the warrior class.

During the Edo period, "Enoshima pilgrimage" became hugely popular among common people. Travelers on the Tokaido road would stop at Enoshima to worship Benzaiten, making it a major leisure activity. The bustling scenes are depicted in Utagawa Hiroshige's ukiyo-e prints, conveying the prosperity of those times.

Due to the Meiji-era separation of Shinto and Buddhism, Benzaiten came to be enshrined as the Eight-Armed Benzaiten statue in the Hōanden hall, but she is still beloved as "Benten-sama" today, drawing worship from many people including those in the entertainment and music industries.

### Architecture and Natural Features

Enoshima Shrine comprises three sanctuaries: Hetsu-miya, Nakatsu-miya, and Okutsu-miya.

**Hetsu-miya**: Located closest to the island entrance, enshrining Tagitsuhime-no-Mikoto. Founded in 1206 (Kennei 1) by Minamoto no Sanetomo. The current shrine building was renovated in 1976 (Showa 51). Within the grounds is "Hōanden," housing one of Japan's Three Great Benzaiten, the "Eight-Armed Benzaiten" statue (National Important Cultural Property).

**Nakatsu-miya**: Located mid-island, enshrining Ichikishimahime-no-Mikoto. Founded in 853 (Ninju 3) by Jikaku Daishi Ennin. The vermillion shrine building is beautiful, and views of Sagami Bay can be seen from the grounds.

**Okutsu-miya**: Located at the island's far end, enshrining Tagorihime-no-Mikoto. The ceiling of the worship hall features a painting of "The All-Seeing Turtle," which mysteriously seems to meet your eyes from any angle.

At the far end of Enoshima are sea caves called "Iwaya." These caves formed by wave erosion have been considered a sacred site of dragon god worship since ancient times and are known as a place where Kobo Daishi and Saint Nichiren practiced asceticism.

### What Makes This Spot Special

What sets Enoshima Shrine apart from other shrines is that "the entire island is a power spot."

Walking the approach path and progressing from Hetsu-miya to Nakatsu-miya to Okutsu-miya, you gradually leave the everyday world behind and feel enveloped in sacred air. The sense of accomplishment upon reaching the Iwaya caves at the far end and the mystical energy there are exceptional.

The shrine is also famous as a power spot for "romantic fulfillment." At the "Lovers' Hill and Dragon Love Bell" in the grounds, it is said that the sound of bells rung by couples deepens their bond. Couples continuously dedicate matchmaking ema (votive tablets).

Since Benzaiten is also the deity of performing arts and music, many artists and musicians visit to pray for success.
