# Hokkaido Jingu Shrine | Complete Guide to Hokkaido's Premier Power Spot【Guardian of the Frontier, Access & Area Info】

In the heart of Sapporo lies a sacred realm encompassed by 60 hectares of primeval forest. Hokkaido Jingu Shrine, established in 1869 alongside the colonization of Hokkaido, serves as the grand guardian shrine of Japan's northern frontier. Approximately 1.8 million visitors make pilgrimages here annually, making it the most revered shrine in all of Hokkaido.

Adjacent to Maruyama Park, the shrine grounds are a natural treasure where Ezo squirrels and over 80 species of wild birds make their home. Walking along the approach, the sounds of the city vanish, replaced by crisp air and the fragrance of ancient forest. Early morning visitors are particularly moved by the divine sight of the shrine buildings emerging from the morning mist.

This shrine, imbued with the prayers of pioneers who tamed the untamed wilderness, has become a power spot renowned for blessing "new beginnings" and "bold ventures." It's especially popular among those embarking on career changes, starting businesses, or relocating—anyone standing at the threshold of a new chapter in life.

## The Allure of This Sacred Site

### History and Origins

Hokkaido Jingu's predecessor was the "Hokkaido Chinza Shinsai," established in Tokyo in 1869. At that time, the Meiji government was promoting Hokkaido's development as a national project, necessitating a shrine to enshrine guardian deities for the colonization effort.

In 1871, the shrine was relocated to Sapporo. Its permanent establishment at the current Maruyama location came in 1889. Originally called "Sapporo Shrine," it was renamed "Hokkaido Jingu" in 1964 when Emperor Meiji was enshrined as an additional deity.

The main deities are Okunitama no Kami, Onamuchi no Kami, Sukunahikona no Kami, and Emperor Meiji. The first three, known as the "Three Deities of Development," are gods governing land development and prosperity, and have watched over Hokkaido's growth since the beginning.

### Architecture and Natural Features

The main sanctuary follows the "shinmei-zukuri" style—the same architectural form used at Ise Grand Shrine. The cypress bark roof and pristine white buildings create a pure beauty that stands brilliantly against Hokkaido's snowy landscape. The snow-draped shrine on a winter morning is breathtakingly divine.

The grounds span approximately 60 hectares of preserved primeval forest. Centuries-old Japanese elms and Mongolian oaks tower overhead while Ezo squirrels, Ezo red foxes, and about 80 species of wild birds inhabit this natural paradise.

In spring, approximately 1,400 cherry and plum trees burst into bloom, making this Hokkaido's premier flower-viewing destination. Seeing cherry blossoms and plum blossoms simultaneously is a spectacle unique to Hokkaido's climate.

### What Makes This Spot Special

Hokkaido Jingu's most distinctive feature is its abundance of energy for "pioneering" and "new beginnings." The prayers and determination of Meiji-era pioneers who challenged untamed wilderness still dwell within this shrine.

The orientation of the torii gates holds special meaning as well. The second torii faces northeast (the demon's gate direction), symbolizing prayers for Hokkaido's continued development and national defense awareness toward Russia.

The shrine is also famous as a "matchmaking" power spot. The Kaitaku Shrine within the grounds attracts many young couples seeking romantic fulfillment. The "love fortune" (koi-mikuji) is popular as a Hokkaido souvenir.
