# Itsukushima Shrine | Complete Guide to Hiroshima's World Heritage Power Spot【Floating Torii Gate, Miyajima Island, Access & Area Info】

Situated on Miyajima Island floating in the Seto Inland Sea, Itsukushima Shrine is a World Heritage Site renowned for its breathtaking scenery—counted among Japan's Three Most Scenic Views—and shrine buildings that preserve the Heian period shinden-zukuri architectural style. The vermillion torii gate standing in the sea, one of Japan's most iconic landscapes, draws approximately 4 million visitors annually from around the world.

Founded in 593 CE during Emperor Suiko's reign, the shrine boasts over 1,400 years of history. Known for Taira no Kiyomori's deep devotion and his construction of the present magnificent shrine buildings, "Aki no Miyajima" has long flourished as an island of both faith and tourism. The mystical experience of shrine buildings appearing to float on the sea at high tide, then walking right up to the great torii gate at low tide, offers something truly unique.

## The Allure of This Sacred Site

### History and Origins

Itsukushima Shrine's founding is attributed to Saeki no Kuramoto in 593 CE, the first year of Empress Suiko's reign. The principal deities are the three Munakata goddesses: Ichikishimahime-no-Mikoto, Tagorihime-no-Mikoto, and Tagitsuhime-no-Mikoto. As guardian deities of maritime traffic, they have gathered faith from those traveling the Seto Inland Sea since ancient times.

The shrine greatly expanded during the late Heian period under Taira no Kiyomori. As Governor of Aki Province, Kiyomori visited Miyajima and adopted Itsukushima Shrine as the guardian deity of the Taira clan. In 1168, he constructed the prototype of the present shrine buildings. During the era when "those who are not Taira are not human," Itsukushima Shrine commanded supreme authority and prosperity.

The shrine continued to receive warrior devotion after the Kamakura period. Mori Motonari, after his victory in the Battle of Itsukushima (1555), undertook repairs to the shrine buildings. During the Edo period, the shrine received patronage from the Asano family, lords of Hiroshima Domain, and continues to welcome numerous worshippers today. In 1996, it was registered as a World Cultural Heritage Site.

### Architecture and Natural Features

Itsukushima Shrine's most distinctive feature is its shrine complex built over the sea. The architecture incorporating Heian period shinden-zukuri style is designated a National Treasure. The Main Hall, Worship Hall, Purification Hall, Takabatai Stage, and Noh Stage are connected by corridors totaling approximately 275m in length—a grand composition.

The current Great Torii is the eighth generation, standing approximately 16.6m tall and weighing about 60 tons. Made from natural camphor wood, it is not buried in the seabed but stands by its own weight. At high tide, it appears to float in the sea; at low tide, visitors can walk right up to it.

Mount Misen (535m elevation) rising behind the shrine is known as a sacred mountain where Kukai trained. Its primeval forest is designated a Natural Monument. From the summit, visitors can enjoy panoramic views of the Seto Inland Sea's island-dotted beauty, easily accessible by ropeway.

### What Makes This Spot Special

Itsukushima Shrine is situated on what has been regarded as a "divine island," with the entire island considered a sacred body. For this reason, births and burials have traditionally been prohibited on the island, maintaining its sanctity. Even today, there is no cemetery on the island, and residents hold funerals on the opposite shore.

The shrine buildings, changing expression with the ebb and flow of tides, show various faces throughout a single day. The "shrine floating on the sea" at high tide, the "approach to the great torii" at low tide, and the "torii silhouetted against sunset"—different mystical scenes await depending on when you visit.

Various Shinto rituals are held throughout the year. The "Kangen-sai" festival, held on a Sunday closest to the 17th day of the sixth lunar month, is a maritime festival said to have been started by Taira no Kiyomori. The fantastical sight of ceremonial boats crossing the sea accompanied by gagaku court music is unforgettable.

## Visitor Reviews and Experiences

**"Enjoyed Twice with Changing Tides"** (Couple in their 50s, Kanagawa)
"We worshipped at morning high tide and walked to the great torii at afternoon low tide. Though the same place, it showed completely different expressions—we enjoyed it twice in one day. Touching the torii's base at low tide was moving."

**"Overwhelmed by World Heritage Magnificence"** (Woman in her 20s, Fukuoka)
"The real thing was more impressive than photos. The shrine buildings standing over the sea were truly mysterious, and thinking they've looked this way since the Heian period made me feel the weight of history."

**"Don't Miss the View from Mount Misen"** (Man in his 40s, Aichi)
"I climbed Mount Misen as well as visiting the shrine. The Seto Inland Sea view from the summit was superb. Having tea warmed by the eternal flame, both body and spirit were warmed."
