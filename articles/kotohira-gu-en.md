Nestled on the slopes of Mount Zozu in Kotohira Town, Kagawa Prefecture, Kotohira-gu Shrine—affectionately known as "Konpira-san" by locals—is one of Japan's most beloved pilgrimage destinations. Famous for its remarkable 785 stone steps leading to the main hall (and 1,368 steps to the inner shrine), this sacred site has drawn millions of visitors for over 1,300 years.

Looking up from the base of the mountain, the stone steps disappear into lush greenery above. As you climb, step by step, the bustling approach lined with souvenir shops and tea houses gradually gives way to profound tranquility. Five minutes in, ten minutes—you begin to feel your everyday worries melting away, replaced by a growing sense of clarity and peace.

Kotohira-gu enshrines Omononushi-no-kami (the Great Deity of Things) and Emperor Sutoku. Omononushi is particularly revered as the guardian deity of maritime safety, having protected sailors and fishermen for centuries. During the Edo period (1603-1868), "Konpira mairi" (pilgrimage to Konpira) was considered a once-in-a-lifetime journey that every Japanese person hoped to make.

Upon reaching the main hall, turn around to behold a breathtaking panorama of the Sanuki Plain spreading below, with the Seto Inland Sea glimmering in the distance. The sense of accomplishment from conquering 785 steps, combined with the spectacular view and the overwhelming spiritual energy accumulated through centuries of devoted worship—it's an experience that touches visitors to their very core.

## Highlights and Attractions

### Over 1,300 Years of History as Guardian of the Seas

*The shrine grounds beneath clear blue skies*

The origins of Kotohira-gu date back to 701 CE (the first year of the Taiho era), making it over 1,300 years old. The shrine was established on Mount Kotohira, originally a training ground for yamabushi (mountain ascetic priests), to enshrine Omononushi-no-kami.

Omononushi, also the principal deity of Omiwa Shrine in Nara, is revered as a guardian of land development, agriculture, commerce, and especially maritime navigation. At Kotohira-gu, the "ocean deity" aspect is particularly emphasized. During the Edo period, the shrine became so popular among sailors that a folk song called "Konpira Fune Fune" (Konpira Ships) spread throughout Japan.

The other enshrined deity, Emperor Sutoku, was a tragic figure who was exiled to Sanuki after his defeat in the Hogen Rebellion of 1156. Enshrined here since the Meiji period, he is venerated as a deity of learning and the performing arts.

### The Story Told by 785 Stone Steps

The most distinctive feature of Kotohira-gu is undoubtedly its long stone stairway. From the Ichinozaka Torii gate at the base to the main hall, you'll climb 785 steps. If you continue to the inner shrine (Izutama Shrine), that number rises to 1,368. This stairway pilgrimage is itself a form of spiritual practice—a journey of purification.

The approach can be divided into several distinct sections:

**Ichinozaka Torii to Daimon Gate (Steps 0-365)**: This initial stretch runs through the lively temple town. Historic souvenir shops, udon restaurants, and traditional sweet shops line both sides, offering plenty of temptations before your climb. For those concerned about their stamina, palanquins carried by porters are available (round trip from around 7,000 yen).

**Daimon to Asahi-sha (Steps 365-628)**: After passing through the Daimon Gate, the sacred atmosphere intensifies dramatically. Impressive stone lanterns line both sides of the path, now surrounded by trees in peaceful silence. Along the way, you'll encounter important cultural properties including the Shoin study hall and Ema-do (votive tablet hall). At step 628, you'll reach the magnificent Asahi-sha, built in 1837 entirely from zelkova wood with temple-like grandeur.

**Asahi-sha to Main Hall (Steps 628-785)**: Beyond Asahi-sha comes the final ascent. Encouraged by occasional glimpses of scenery through the trees, you climb the remaining steps until—at step 785—you finally arrive at the main worship hall.

From the main hall, the Sanuki Plain spreads before you, and on clear days, you can see all the way to the Seto Inland Sea. This combination of breathtaking views, sense of accomplishment, and the sacred presence emanating from the main sanctuary creates profound impressions that stay with visitors forever.

**Main Hall to Inner Shrine (Steps 785-1,368)**: For those with extra time and energy, the inner shrine (Izutama Shrine) awaits. From the main hall, it's another 583 steps—1,368 total. This section sees far fewer pilgrims, offering a quiet mountain path. The views from the inner shrine are even more spectacular, with 360-degree panoramic vistas.

### Cultural Treasures and Must-See Spots

![Main shrine building](https://k005.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/pexels-161401-1.jpg)
*Traditional Japanese shrine architecture*

The shrine grounds contain numerous important cultural properties and noteworthy sights:

**Omote-shoin and Oku-shoin**: These Edo-period study halls feature exceptional fusuma (sliding door) paintings by renowned artists including Maruyama Okyo. Okyo's "Tigers at Play" is particularly famous (replicas displayed in the treasure hall; originals shown only during special exhibitions).

**Ema-do (Votive Tablet Hall)**: This hall displays numerous large votive tablets donated since the Edo period. Ship-themed tablets predominate, telling the story of the shrine's connection to maritime worship.

**Asahi-sha**: This magnificent zelkova-wood structure features exquisite carvings and serves as one of the shrine's most impressive buildings—and a popular photography spot.

**Treasure Hall**: Houses art and artifacts passed down through the shrine's history, including works by Maruyama Okyo, swords, ceramics, and other treasures (admission 800 yen).

### Beauty Through Four Seasons

*Autumn colors adorn the shrine grounds*

Kotohira-gu reveals different beautiful faces throughout the year:

**Spring (March-May)**: Cherry blossoms burst into bloom along the approach. The cherry tree-lined path near Daimon Gate is particularly stunning, drawing many hanami (flower viewing) visitors.

**Early Summer (June)**: Hydrangeas add color along the stone steps, lending a gentle atmosphere to the rainy season.

**Autumn (Mid-to-Late November)**: Peak autumn foliage season transforms the approach with red and golden leaves. The area around Asahi-sha is especially renowned for its fall colors.

**Winter (December-February)**: Fewer visitors make this the ideal season for quiet, contemplative worship. Occasional snowfall creates an otherworldly atmosphere with the shrine dressed in white.

## Spiritual Benefits and Blessings

### Maritime Safety and Protection for Travelers

Kotohira-gu's most famous blessing is **maritime safety and protection for sea voyages**. Since the Edo period, sailors and fishermen have offered prayers here for safe return from their journeys at sea. Today, people involved in maritime work or planning overseas travel frequently visit to pray for safety.

By extension, the shrine also offers protection for **all travel and transportation safety**, including road travel by car.

### Business Success and Commercial Prosperity

As Omononushi is also the deity of commerce and industry, the shrine is popular among business owners and merchants praying for **commercial success and business prosperity**. During the Edo period, making a pilgrimage to Konpira was a status symbol for merchants, and the shrine was considered essential for prayers for business growth.

Today, entrepreneurs visit to pray for new business success, company prosperity, and favorable business negotiations.

### Fortune Opening and Misfortune Warding

Completing the climb of those many stone steps is believed to **purify mind and body**, bringing **good fortune** and **protection from misfortune**. The process of climbing step by step becomes like spiritual training—a time for facing oneself—leaving many visitors feeling spiritually cleansed.

The shrine is particularly recommended for visiting before major life transitions or when starting new endeavors.

### Academic Success and Artistic Achievement

Because Emperor Sutoku is enshrined here, visitors also pray for **academic success** and **improvement in artistic pursuits**. Many students preparing for exams and those involved in arts and performance visit to seek blessings.

### Visitor Experiences

*"The sense of accomplishment when I finally reached step 785 was indescribable. Looking out at the view from the main hall, I reflected on my life journey and renewed my resolve for the future."* (42-year-old man from Tokyo)

*"With an overseas assignment coming up, I visited to pray for safety. I kept the omamori (protective charm) with me always, and completed my three-year posting safely."* (38-year-old woman from Osaka)

*"I came to pray before starting a new business venture. During the climb, I repeatedly confirmed my determination. Since then, the business has grown steadily."* (50-year-old man from Fukuoka)

## Best Times to Visit

### Spring (March-May) ★★★★★

Spring at Kotohira-gu is highly recommended for its beautiful cherry blossoms and pleasant weather. From late March to early April, the cherry trees along the approach reach full bloom. The cherry tree-lined avenue near Daimon Gate is especially beautiful—climbing the steps while enjoying hanami is a special experience.

Temperatures range from 15-20°C (59-68°F), ideal for climbing. However, the cherry blossom season brings crowds, so early morning visits on weekdays (7-9 AM) are recommended.

Golden Week (late April to early May) is also crowded, but fresh green foliage makes it a refreshing time to visit.

### Summer (June-August) ★★☆☆☆

June's rainy season brings hydrangeas to the approach. Be careful on wet, slippery steps, but the atmosphere has its own misty charm.

July and August bring temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), making the climb very sweaty work. Early morning (6-8 AM) or late afternoon (after 4 PM) visits are strongly recommended. Avoid midday climbs and bring plenty of water.

Summer vacation brings family crowds.

### Autumn (September-November) ★★★★★

Autumn rivals spring as the ideal season for visiting Kotohira-gu. September still holds summer's warmth, but October through November sees temperatures drop to around 20°C (68°F), making for very comfortable climbing.

Mid-to-late November brings peak autumn colors as trees along the approach turn red and gold. The foliage around Asahi-sha is particularly beautiful and draws many visitors. Fall foliage weekends are crowded, but weekdays are relatively quiet.

On clear autumn days, the Seto Inland Sea is clearly visible from the main hall, offering spectacular views.

### Winter (December-February) ★★★☆☆

Winter brings fewer visitors, making it an excellent time for quiet, contemplative worship. Temperatures around 5-10°C (41-50°F) mean the climb warms you up, though warm clothing is essential for mornings and evenings.

New Year brings major crowds. Avoid January 1-3 if possible. After mid-January, crowds diminish.

Occasional snowfall creates magical scenery, though exercise extreme caution on icy steps or consider postponing your visit.

### Recommended Time Slots

**Early Morning (6-8 AM)**: The quietest, most refreshing time. Morning sunlight illuminates the steps, and the atmosphere is particularly sacred. Perfect for avoiding crowds.

**Mid-Morning (8-11 AM)**: Relatively cool, before tour buses arrive. Allows for leisurely worship.

**Midday (11 AM-3 PM)**: Most crowded period. Group tourists are numerous, and summer heat is oppressive. Best avoided.

**Late Afternoon (3-5 PM)**: Beautiful soft afternoon light. Crowds begin to thin for more peaceful visits.

## Worship Guide

### Tips for Conquering the Stone Steps

Here are tips for successfully climbing all 785 steps:

**1. Pace Yourself**: Starting too fast leads to exhaustion later. Climb slowly at a steady pace. Aim to reach the main hall in 30-40 minutes.

**2. Take Breaks**: Benches and tea houses dot the route. Rest without pushing yourself. The Daimon Gate (step 365) and Asahi-sha (step 628) make good rest stops.

**3. Stay Hydrated**: Essential, especially in summer. While vendors sell drinks along the way, bringing your own water bottle is recommended.

**4. Mind Your Breathing**: Deep, slow breathing while climbing helps prevent fatigue.

**5. Consider the Palanquin**: For those lacking stamina, elderly visitors, or anyone feeling unwell, the palanquin service is available (one-way to Daimon Gate 3,800 yen, round trip 7,000 yen).

1. Offer money in the offertory box (any amount; 5-yen or 50-yen coins are considered auspicious)

3. Bow deeply twice
4. Clap hands twice
5. Pray silently from your heart
