# Lake Toya | Complete Guide to Hokkaido's Volcanic Power Spot【World Geopark, Mount Usu, Access & Area Info】

Located in southwestern Hokkaido, Lake Toya is a caldera lake formed by a massive volcanic eruption approximately 110,000 years ago. With a circumference of about 43 kilometers and maximum depth of 180 meters, this beautiful lake was certified as the "Toya-Usu UNESCO Global Geopark" in 2009, drawing attention as a mystical power spot where visitors can feel the Earth's living breath.

Nakajima Island floating in the center of the lake, the still-active Mount Usu, and the abundant hot springs welling up along the lakeshore—Lake Toya is a special place where the "blessings of fire and water" interweave. The Ainu people have long called this lake "Toya" (lake shore) and revered it as a sacred place.

Beautiful scenery can be enjoyed throughout all four seasons, with the reflection of Mount Yotei in the lake surface particularly famous as the "Ezo Fuji" (Fuji of Hokkaido). In 2008, it served as the venue for the G8 Summit, broadcasting its beauty to the world.

## The Allure of This Sacred Site

### History and Origins

Lake Toya's birth dates back approximately 110,000 years. A large-scale volcanic eruption caused the summit to collapse, forming a massive caldera about 11 kilometers in diameter. Water then accumulated in the crater, creating the present-day Lake Toya.

The name "Toya" derives from the Ainu words "To-Ya" meaning "lake-shore." For the Ainu people, this lake was a sacred place that provided abundant blessings—fish from the lake, wild vegetables from surrounding forests, and hot springs. People have lived in this area while giving thanks for nature's bounty.

Mount Usu, located on the lakeshore, is one of the world's most active volcanoes, having erupted four times in the past 100 years. The 1977 eruption and the 2000 eruption caused significant damage, but simultaneously blessed this region with rich hot springs and fertile land. People have lived here in coexistence with the volcano, receiving its benefits.

In 2009, this "coexistence between volcanoes and humans" was recognized, and the area was certified as Japan's first UNESCO Global Geopark under the name "Toya-Usu Geopark."

### Architecture and Natural Features

Lake Toya is a caldera lake with a circumference of approximately 43 kilometers, surface area of 70.7 square kilometers, and maximum depth of 180 meters. It is Japan's ninth largest lake and third largest in Hokkaido.

Its greatest feature is "Nakajima"—four islands floating in the center of the lake: Oshima, Kannon Island, Benten Island, and Manju Island. These islands are lava domes formed by volcanic activity about 50,000 years ago and are now a natural treasure trove where wild Ezo deer live.

From Mount Usu (737 meters elevation) located northwest of the lake, visitors can enjoy panoramic views of Lake Toya. A ropeway takes you near the summit, where on clear days you can see steaming Showa Shinzan and even the distant Pacific Ocean.

Additionally, Lake Toya is known as a "non-freezing lake" that never freezes even in winter. Its beautiful surface can be enjoyed year-round, another major attraction of Lake Toya.

Mount Yotei (1,898 meters elevation) viewed from the lakeshore is called "Ezo Fuji," and its beautiful conical silhouette reflected in the lake surface is Lake Toya's signature scenic view.

### What Makes This Spot Special

What sets Lake Toya apart from other lakes is being alongside a "living volcano."

Mount Usu continues its activity today, and during the 2000 eruption, despite a hot spring resort being located only about 1 kilometer from the crater, early prediction and evacuation resulted in zero deaths—a miracle. This experience has attracted worldwide attention as a model case for "coexistence with volcanoes."

Additionally, the "Lake Toya Long Run Fireworks Festival" held from late April through October features fireworks launched over the lake every night for about half a year—an event unlike any other. The fireworks reflected on the lake surface with mountain silhouettes behind create dreamlike beauty.

## Spiritual Benefits and Effects

### Known Spiritual Benefits

As a natural power spot, Lake Toya is believed to offer these effects:

**Mind-Body Purification & Refreshment**: The environment surrounded by the vast lake and majestic mountains releases daily stress and resets body and mind.

**Renewal & New Beginnings**: The power of Mount Usu, which has recovered from repeated eruptions, conveys energy of "renewal" and "new beginnings." Many visit during life's turning points.

**Health Fortune**: Toya Onsen has long been known for its "beauty bath" waters, believed to heal physical and mental fatigue and restore health through bathing.

**Creativity & Inspiration**: Many report that touching majestic nature brings forth new ideas and inspiration.

### The Unique Energy of This Site

What many visitors sense at Lake Toya is "the Earth's life force" itself.

Mount Usu, an active volcano, is an existence that makes you truly feel that "the Earth is alive." Gazing at the steam-emitting mountain, you experience a strange sense of scale that makes human worries seem insignificant.

Meanwhile, Lake Toya, quietly holding its waters, has an enveloping gentleness. Fire (Mount Usu) and water (Lake Toya), motion and stillness—this place where contrasting energies coexist is especially recommended for those wanting to restore balance.

### Visitor Testimonials

"I visited before quitting my job to start my own business. Watching Mount Usu's steam, I felt that 'no matter what happens, I can rise again.'" (Man in his 40s, Tokyo)

"I come to Lake Toya Onsen for therapeutic bathing every year. The time spent gazing at the lake while soaking in hot springs resets my entire year." (Woman in her 60s, Sapporo)

## Visitor's Guide

### How to Enjoy Lake Toya

As Lake Toya is a natural power spot rather than a shrine or temple, there is no specific worship etiquette. Here are recommended ways to fully experience Lake Toya's power.

**1. Lakeside Stroll**
The "Ukimido Park" area extending from Toya Onsen town toward Nakajima is a spot where you can feel the lake up close. Sit on a bench and spend quiet time gazing at the lake.

**2. Cruise to Nakajima**
Nakajima has the "Nakajima Lake Forest Museum" where you can learn about Lake Toya's nature and history. You may encounter wild Ezo deer. Round trip takes about 50 minutes.

**3. Mount Usu Ropeway**
About 7 minutes' walk from the summit station to the observation deck. A 360-degree panorama spreads out—Lake Toya, Showa Shinzan, the crater, the Pacific Ocean. A spot where you can feel the volcano's power with your whole body.

**4. Relax in Toya Onsen**
Many hot spring inns line the lakeshore. Day-use bathing facilities are plentiful, and bathing while viewing the lake is exceptional. "Manseikaku" and "Nonokaze Resort" are popular.

### Spending Time as a Power Spot

**Take Time to Quietly Gaze at the Lake**: Put away your phone and spend even just 30 minutes simply watching the lake surface. The water's energy calms the heart.

**Feel the "Fire" Energy at Mount Usu**: Seeing the steam-emitting crater lets you truly sense Earth's life force. Courage to start something new wells up.

**"Purify" in Hot Springs**: Hot springs welling from the earth wash away physical and mental fatigue. If possible, stay overnight and bathe morning and evening.

### Dress Code and What to Bring

- **Clothing**: Winds can be strong by the lake, so bring a light jacket even in summer. Mount Usu is higher elevation, so bring an extra layer.
- **What to Bring**: Camera, sunscreen (summer), warm clothing (spring/autumn/winter)
- **Note**: There are restricted areas around Mount Usu. Follow posted signs.
