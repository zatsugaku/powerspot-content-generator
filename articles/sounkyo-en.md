# Sounkyo Gorge | Complete Guide to Hokkaido's Mountain Power Spot【Daisetsuzan, Columnar Joints, Access & Area Info】

Located in the heart of Hokkaido within Daisetsuzan National Park, Sounkyo Gorge is a magnificent canyon formed by a massive eruption of Mount Daisetsu approximately 30,000 years ago. Stretching about 24 kilometers along the Ishikari River, the towering cliffs rise 100 to 200 meters high, overwhelming visitors with their sheer scale.

The Ainu people called this place "Souunbetsu" (river with many waterfalls) and revered it as a sacred site from ancient times. The columnar joint cliffs that line the canyon resemble stone pillars reaching toward the heavens. The twin waterfalls known as "Ginga Falls" (Galaxy Falls) and "Ryusei Falls" (Meteor Falls) are designated among Japan's 100 Famous Waterfalls.

With the onsen town as a base, visitors can enjoy the spectacular views of Daisetsuzan via ropeway while taking in the canyon's beauty. Sounkyo Gorge is a healing and regenerative power spot where you can experience the full force of Hokkaido's natural power.

## The Allure of This Sacred Site

### History and Origins

Sounkyo Gorge's history began with a massive eruption of Mount Daisetsu approximately 30,000 years ago. As the erupted lava cooled rapidly, it formed the distinctive columnar joints. Subsequently, erosion by the Ishikari River carved out the canyon landscape we see today.

The name "Sounkyo" was given by travel writer Keigetsu Omachi when he visited in 1921 (Taisho 10). Meaning "gorge where clouds rise in layers," it describes the mystical scenery created by mist covering the canyon and the columnar joint cliffs.

The Ainu people called this place "Souunbetsu" (river with many waterfalls) and revered it as a sacred site. Particularly, Ginga Falls and Ryusei Falls appear in Ainu mythology and were objects of spiritual worship.

Hot springs were discovered in the Meiji era, and development as a tourist destination began in the Taisho period. Since being designated part of Daisetsuzan National Park in 1934 (Showa 9), it has attracted numerous tourists as one of Hokkaido's premier scenic spots.

### Architecture and Natural Features

Sounkyo Gorge's most striking feature is the columnar joint cliffs that extend for approximately 24 kilometers. As the lava cooled, regular fractures formed, creating a distinctive terrain of bundled pentagonal and hexagonal pillars. The cliffs reach heights of 100 to 200 meters, presenting an awe-inspiring spectacle.

The most famous attractions are Ginga Falls (Galaxy Falls) and Ryusei Falls (Meteor Falls). Ginga Falls has a drop of 120 meters, flowing down in thin white threads like silk, earning it the nickname "Female Falls." Meanwhile, Ryusei Falls has a 90-meter drop, cascading powerfully in one great rush, known as the "Male Falls." The view from "Sobakudai" observation platform, where both waterfalls can be seen simultaneously, is breathtaking.

From Sounkyo Onsen, a ropeway and lift system takes visitors up to the 7th station (7-gome) of Mount Kurodake (elevation 1,984 meters). From the summit, a magnificent panorama of the Daisetsu mountain range spreads out. In July, Japan's earliest autumn colors appear, and spectacular fall foliage can be enjoyed from late September.

### What Makes This Spot Special

What sets Sounkyo Gorge apart from other scenic locations is the intersection of three natural forces: "volcano," "water," and "hot springs."

The columnar joint cliffs born from volcanic activity, the waterfalls cascading down these cliffs, and the hot springs welling up from deep underground—it is extremely rare to find all of these concentrated in one place.

Sounkyo is also famous for offering "Japan's earliest autumn colors." At higher elevations on Daisetsu, fall foliage begins as early as late August, with the entire mountain turning red and gold by mid-September. As the saying goes, "Autumn in Japan begins at Daisetsuzan," drawing visitors from across the country seeking autumn colors.

In winter, the "Sounkyo Hyobaku (Ice Waterfall) Festival" is held, creating a fantastical world of frozen waterfalls and illuminated ice sculptures.

## Spiritual Benefits and Effects

### Known Spiritual Benefits

Though Sounkyo Gorge is not a shrine or temple but a natural power spot, it has been said since ancient times to offer the following effects:

**Mind-Body Purification & Refreshment**: The negative ions released from the waterfalls, the fresh forest air, and the healing properties of the hot springs combine to purify and refresh both mind and body.

**Stress Relief & Healing**: Being surrounded by magnificent nature releases you from daily stress and provides deep healing. Many report that standing before the waterfalls makes their worries seem insignificant.

**Renewal & New Beginnings**: The land born from volcanic activity is filled with energy of "destruction and regeneration." Many visit during life transitions, and it is said that one can receive the power to make new starts.

**Enhanced Vitality**: Daisetsuzan is called "Kamui Mintara" (the playground of the gods) and is considered a place full of life force. Sounkyo Gorge, located at its base, is also believed to have strong life energy.

### The Unique Energy of This Site

What many visitors sense at Sounkyo Gorge is the "overwhelming sense of scale" and "the Earth's life force."

When looking up at the cliffs exceeding 100 meters, one realizes their own smallness while simultaneously being overwhelmed by the power of the land formed over millions of years. This experience has the effect of putting daily worries into perspective and lightening the heart.

Additionally, many people feel a sense of physical and mental purification from experiencing the roar and spray of the waterfalls with their whole body. There are numerous accounts of tears flowing spontaneously when standing before Ginga Falls and Ryusei Falls.

### Visitor Testimonials

"I visited when I was burned out from work. The moment I looked up at the towering cliffs, all my worries seemed to melt away. Soaking in the hot springs, I felt like I was slowly reclaiming myself." (Man in his 40s, Tokyo)

"I visited during autumn foliage season. I was speechless at the sight of the entire mountain burning red. I felt the greatness of nature, and gratitude for being alive welled up inside me." (Woman in her 50s, Sapporo)

## Best Times to Visit

### Spring (May–June)
The ropeway resumes operation in early May. The contrast between lingering snow on Daisetsuzan and fresh greenery is beautiful. Fewer tourists make for peaceful nature viewing. Alpine flowers begin blooming in June.
**Recommendation: ★★★★☆**

### Summer (July–August)
Best season for Daisetsuzan mountain climbing. In early July, Japan's earliest autumn colors begin with chinguruma (avens) and other alpine plants. Full-scale fall foliage starts from late August near the summit. The cool climate also makes it ideal for escaping summer heat.
**Recommendation: ★★★★★**

### Autumn (September–October)
Peak autumn foliage season. Mid to late September is the peak for Daisetsuzan fall colors, with the entire mountain draped in gradients of red, yellow, and green. By early October, the entire gorge is wrapped in autumn colors. Crowded but worth seeing.
**Recommendation: ★★★★★**

### Winter (November–April)
The Sounkyo Hyobaku Festival runs from late January to mid-March. The illuminated frozen waterfalls and ice sculptures are fantastical. Despite the severe cold, the combination of hot springs and winter experiences is unique. The ropeway operates in winter (may close in bad weather).
**Recommendation: ★★★☆☆**

### Best Times of Day

**Early Morning (5:00–7:00 AM)**: The gorge wrapped in morning mist is mystical. You can witness the scenery true to the name "Sounkyo" (layered clouds gorge).

**Morning (8:00 AM–12:00 PM)**: Ropeway begins operation. Views of Daisetsuzan are best in the morning.

**Afternoon (1:00–5:00 PM)**: Ideal for waterfall viewing and gorge walks. The lighting makes the waterfalls shine beautifully.

**Evening–Night**: Relax in the onsen town. During the Hyobaku Festival, night illuminations are available.
