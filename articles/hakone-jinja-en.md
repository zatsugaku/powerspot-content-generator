# Hakone Shrine | Complete Guide to Kanagawa's Power Spot【Lake Ashi, Kuzuryu Shrine, Access & Area Info】

Located on the shores of Lake Ashi in Hakone Town, Ashigarashimo District, Kanagawa Prefecture, Hakone Shrine is one of the Kanto region's premier power spots with approximately 1,250 years of history. Founded in 757 (Tenpyo-hoji 1) by the monk Mangan Shonin, it has long been revered as the "Guardian of All Kanto" by samurai warriors and commoners alike.

The enshrined deity is Hakone Okami—three deities: Ninigi-no-Mikoto, Konohanasakuya-hime-no-Mikoto, and Hikohohodemi-no-Mikoto. The shrine is known for wide-ranging blessings including fortune opening, wish fulfillment, and traffic safety.

The vermillion "Peace Torii" (Heiwa no Torii) standing in Lake Ashi is Hakone's signature scenic spot. The "dual shrine visit" with adjacent Kuzuryu Shrine is considered the ultimate power spot course for matchmaking and financial fortune, drawing approximately 2 million visitors annually.

## The Allure of This Sacred Site

### History and Origins

Hakone Shrine's founding dates to 757 (Tenpyo-hoji 1). The Nara period eminent monk Mangan Shonin received a divine revelation while practicing asceticism at the summit of Mount Komagatake in the Hakone mountains, and built a shrine at this location on the shores of Lake Ashi.

During the Heian period, Sakanoue no Tamuramaro prayed for victory here before his eastern campaign, and subsequently Minamoto no Yoritomo, the Hojo clan, Tokugawa Ieyasu, and successive military commanders all visited for worship. Particularly, Minamoto no Yoritomo, after his defeat at the Battle of Ishibashiyama, prayed at this shrine and vowed to rise again, eventually going on to establish the Kamakura Shogunate.

During the Edo period, it was called "Hakone Gongen" as a guardian deity for travelers on the Tokaido road, gathering widespread worship. Following the Meiji-era separation of Shinto and Buddhism, it was renamed "Hakone Shrine" and continues to this day.

Adjacent Kuzuryu Shrine is said to have even older history than Hakone Shrine, a sacred site of dragon deity worship. Enshrining the nine-headed dragon residing in Lake Ashi, it is known for blessings of matchmaking and financial fortune improvement.

### Architecture and Natural Features

Hakone Shrine is situated at approximately 730 meters elevation on the shores of Lake Ashi. The main hall was constructed in 1667 (Kanbun 7) by Tokugawa Ietsuna, with its vermillion shrine buildings striking against the deep forest.

The approach path consists of stone steps leading from Lake Ashi, lined on both sides with giant cedars over 800 years old, including a sacred tree called "Yatate no Sugi" (Arrow-Standing Cedar). Many people feel their hearts being purified just by walking this approach.

Most famous is the "Peace Torii" standing in Lake Ashi. Built in 1952 (Showa 27), this vermillion torii gate is beautiful with its reflection on the lake surface, and as the symbolic view of Hakone, many tourists photograph it.

Kuzuryu Shrine's main shrine is located about a 30-minute walk along the lakeshore from Hakone Shrine. On the 13th of every month, a "Tsukinami-sai" (monthly festival) is held with special worship boats operating, gathering worshippers from across the country.

### What Makes This Spot Special

What sets Hakone Shrine apart from other shrines is its extremely strong "dragon vein energy."

The Hakone mountains have long been worshipped as mountains where dragons dwell, and Lake Ashi has been considered the dwelling place of dragon deities. By making a "dual shrine visit" to both Hakone Shrine and Kuzuryu Shrine, it is said you can receive the maximum power of the dragon deity.

Also, Hakone is a key transportation point connecting east and west, a place with strong energy of "turning points" and "change." Many visit at life transitions, and it is said to grant the power to forge new paths.

The historical episode of Minamoto no Yoritomo making his comeback also supports this shrine's power of "revival and renewal."
