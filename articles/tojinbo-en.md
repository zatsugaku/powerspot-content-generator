# Tojinbo | Complete Guide to Fukui's Power Spot【Columnar Joints, Sea Cliffs, Access & Area Info】

Located in Mikuni Town, Sakai City, Fukui Prefecture, Tojinbo is a magnificent sea cliff carved by the rough waves of the Sea of Japan. The columnar joint rock walls stretching approximately 1 kilometer reach heights of about 25 meters and are designated as a National Natural Monument and Place of Scenic Beauty.

These rare pyroxene andesite columnar joints are said to exist at only three locations in the world at this scale. This spectacular landscape, formed by volcanic activity approximately 13 million years ago, is a power spot where visitors can experience nature's awesome power, attracting about 1.5 million visitors annually.

The name "Tojinbo" is said to derive from a legend about a monk who once lived in this area. This place where nature's raw power and historical legend intersect is visited by many at life's turning points, offering a power spot that resets the mind and gives strength to take new steps forward.

## The Allure of This Sacred Site

### History and Origins

A sad legend is associated with the name Tojinbo. Long ago, there was a monk named Tojinbo at Heisenji Temple (in present-day Katsuyama City). He was said to be violent and troublesome to the villagers, and was pushed off these cliffs by villagers who held a grudge against him.

It is said that the sea remained rough for 49 days afterward, leading to this place being called "Tojinbo." However, this is merely legend, and there are various theories about the actual origin of the name.

Geologically, Tojinbo was formed by volcanic activity approximately 13 million years ago. As magma cooled rapidly near the surface, regular fractures (joints) formed, creating the current columnar rock formations.

It was designated as a National Natural Monument and Place of Scenic Beauty in 1935 (Showa 10). In 1972 (Showa 47), it was incorporated into Echizen-Kaga Kaigan Quasi-National Park. Today, it is Fukui Prefecture's representative tourist attraction, drawing many visitors from Japan and abroad.

### Architecture and Natural Features

Tojinbo's greatest feature is its "pyroxene andesite columnar joints." This is an extremely rare geological formation worldwide, and similar-scale examples are said to exist only at Mount Kumgang on the Korean Peninsula and Norway's west coast.

Columnar joints are polygonal (mainly pentagonal and hexagonal) columnar fractures that form when magma contracts in volume as it cools and solidifies. At Tojinbo, these columnar rocks extend continuously for about 1 kilometer, reaching a maximum height of approximately 25 meters.

From the tip of the cliff called "Oike," a grand panorama of the Sea of Japan spreads out. On clear days, you can see as far as the Noto Peninsula, and at sunset, the sun sinking into the Sea of Japan creates a spectacular view.

From Tojinbo Tower (55 meters high), you can overlook the entire columnar joint formation and the Sea of Japan. On good weather days, it's a viewpoint from which you can see all the way to the Hakusan mountain range.

### What Makes This Spot Special

What sets Tojinbo apart from other scenic spots is its "raw natural power" and "ability to help people reflect on life."

Standing on the sea cliffs and looking down at the rough waves of the Sea of Japan, you realize human smallness before nature's overwhelming power. This experience relativizes daily worries and resets the heart.

Tojinbo is also known for being visited by many at "life's turning points." When facing major decisions or feeling stuck, standing in this place is said to broaden perspectives and reveal new paths.

The columnar joints viewed from the sea on a sightseeing boat offer a different kind of impact than viewing from land. You can enjoy this natural artwork from various angles.

## Spiritual Benefits and Effects

### Known Spiritual Benefits

While Tojinbo is not a shrine or temple but a natural power spot, it is said to offer the following effects:

**Mind-Body Purification & Refreshment**: The sea breeze from the Sea of Japan and the wild natural energy blow away accumulated fatigue and stress. The sense of liberation when standing at the cliff's edge is exceptional.

**Enhanced Decision-Making & Action**: Facing nature's overwhelming power, you become aware of how you were worrying about small things, and decision-making ability is said to increase. This is why many visit at life's turning points.

**Renewal & New Beginnings**: Just as rough waves carve rock and continue creating new forms, you can shed your old self and receive power to be reborn as a new person.

**Warding Off Evil & Purification**: The rough waves of the Sea of Japan are said to have purifying power, washing away negative energy.

### The Unique Energy of This Site

What many visitors sense at Tojinbo is an "overwhelming sense of scale" and "reverence for nature."

Facing the 25-meter cliff, you keenly feel that there are things human power cannot overcome. This experience conversely generates a positive feeling of "let me focus on what I can do."

Also, facing terrain formed over 13 million mind-boggling years, you realize how short-term life's worries really are. Many report feeling lighter in heart.

### Visitor Testimonials

"I visited when struggling with whether to quit my job. Standing on the cliff looking at the sea, I thought 'it's a waste of time to keep worrying,' and I could make my decision." (Man in his 30s, Osaka)

"A friend brought me here when I was depressed after my divorce. Watching the rough waves, I mysteriously felt energized and thought 'I can try again.'" (Woman in her 40s, Ishikawa)
