# Haguro-san Shrine | Complete Guide to Yamagata's Sacred Power Spot【Dewa Sanzan, Access & Area Info】

## 2,446 Stone Steps Lead to the Sacred Mountain of Shugendo

Haguro-san, located in Tsuruoka City, Yamagata Prefecture, is one of Japan's most revered sacred mountains. Together with Mount Gassan and Mount Yudono, it forms the "Dewa Sanzan" (Three Mountains of Dewa), a pilgrimage site that has drawn devotees for over 1,400 years. The Dewa Shrine atop Haguro-san, commonly called "Haguro-san Shrine," enshrines all three mountain deities in one location, welcoming pilgrims throughout the year.

The approach from Zuishinmon Gate to the summit features an extraordinary 2,446 stone steps. Constructed over 13 years during the Edo period, this path winds through an avenue of ancient cedar trees aged 300 to 600 years. Designated as a Special Natural Monument, these approximately 580 towering cedars form a majestic tunnel, guiding visitors toward the sacred realm above.

Climbing each step brings you closer to this 1,400-year-old center of Shugendo mountain asceticism. Sunlight filters through the forest canopy, your footsteps echo on ancient stones, birdsong drifts from the trees—each step transforms from ordinary journey to sacred pilgrimage. Upon reaching the summit, the panoramic view of the Shonai Plain and Sea of Japan, combined with the overwhelming spiritual presence of Sanjin Gosaiden Hall, moves countless visitors to profound emotion.

## Highlights and Attractions

### Center of Dewa Sanzan Faith

Haguro-san was founded in 593 CE by Prince Hachiko, son of Emperor Sushun. Fleeing political upheaval, the prince arrived in this region and, led by a three-legged crow, discovered Haguro-san.

The three mountains symbolize "present life" (Haguro-san), "past life" (Gassan), and "future life" (Yudono). Pilgrimaging to all three is believed to achieve spiritual rebirth. Haguro-san, as the "mountain for praying for happiness in this life," serves as the most accessible entry point to Dewa Sanzan worship.

As a sacred site of Shugendo, Haguro-san continues to host yamabushi (mountain ascetic) training today. From late August to early September, the "Aki no Mine-iri" intensive training brings practitioners from across Japan for rigorous spiritual discipline.

### The Mystical Beauty of the National Treasure Five-Story Pagoda

One of Haguro-san's greatest treasures is the National Treasure Five-Story Pagoda. Approximately 10 minutes up the stone steps from Zuishinmon Gate, this pagoda emerges suddenly from the cedar forest—the oldest tower structure in the Tohoku region.

Traditionally attributed to Taira no Masakado, the current structure was rebuilt approximately 600 years ago during the Muromachi period. Standing 29 meters tall with a three-bay, five-story design and cypress bark roof, its unadorned wooden construction exudes quiet dignity. The simple, unpainted beauty harmonizes perfectly with the surrounding cedars, as if the pagoda has become one with the forest.

Early morning or evening, when mist envelops the pagoda, creates particularly mystical scenes that draw photographers year-round. Each season brings new beauty: cherry blossoms in spring, deep green in summer, autumn colors, and winter snow.

### The 2,446 Stone Steps

Haguro-san's stone stairway stretches approximately 1.7 kilometers with 2,446 steps—among Japan's longest pilgrimage approaches. These steps were constructed between 1648 and 1661 under the direction of Priest Tenyu.

Carved into the stones are 33 small relief sculptures including sake cups, crabs, and gourds. Legend holds that finding all 33 grants a wish. The sake cup carving is particularly difficult to spot, and finding it supposedly ensures you'll never lack for sake throughout your life.

Several notable sites mark the path: Suga Falls crossing the Harai River, the Ninozaka Tea House rest stop, and the "Jiji-sugi" (Grandfather Cedar)—a giant tree over 1,000 years old with a trunk circumference of about 8 meters and height of 43 meters, standing as Haguro-san's iconic symbol.

### The Majesty of Sanjin Gosaiden

Sanjin Gosaiden Hall at the summit enshrines all three deities of Dewa Sanzan (Gassan, Haguro-san, and Yudono). Its massive thatched roof—28 meters high and 26 meters across—makes it one of Japan's largest thatched-roof structures.

The current hall, rebuilt in 1818, is designated an Important Cultural Property. Because heavy winter snow makes Gassan and Yudono inaccessible, this combined hall allows pilgrims to worship all three mountains year-round.

Within the precinct lies "Kagami-ike" (Mirror Pond), where bronze mirrors have been offered since ancient times. Over 500 mirrors have been discovered, with many displayed at the Dewa Sanzan Historical Museum.

## Spiritual Benefits and Blessings

### Good Fortune, Career Success, and Competitive Edge

Haguro-san is known for "gense-riyaku" (benefits in this life), particularly fortune in business, career advancement, and success in competition. Completing all 2,446 steps is said to forge mental and physical strength, developing strong willpower and decision-making ability.

Business professionals, students facing exams, and athletes before important competitions all visit seeking blessings. "The sense of accomplishment from climbing gave me confidence at work" and "I visited before my exam and passed brilliantly" are common testimonials.

### Purification and Protection

As a Shugendo sacred site, Haguro-san possesses powerful purifying energy. Many feel that climbing step by step cleanses body and spirit, washing away everyday stress and worries.

The mountain is particularly recommended during life transitions or when seeking a fresh start. "My mind felt completely reset" and "I can move forward with renewed energy" are frequently shared experiences.

### Family Safety and Abundant Harvests

Dewa Sanzan has long been worshipped as a deity of agriculture, offering blessings for family safety and bountiful harvests. Farmers throughout the Shonai region have prayed here for good crops for generations.

### Visitor Testimonials

*"Honestly, the 2,446 steps were tough, but the sense of accomplishment at the top was incredible. Standing before Sanjin Gosaiden, I nearly cried."* (Man in 40s, Tokyo)

*"The Five-Story Pagoda took my breath away. Its quiet presence within the forest is truly mystical—photos can't capture its impact."* (Woman in 30s, Miyagi)

*"I nearly gave up partway through, but encouraging fellow pilgrims helped me continue. An unforgettable experience."* (Man in 20s, Kanagawa)

## Best Times to Visit

### Spring (April-May) ★★★★☆

From mid-April through early May, Haguro-san welcomes fresh green season. Winter snow melts away as trees begin budding, filling the entire mountain with vital energy.

Cherry blossoms near the Five-Story Pagoda peak in late April, creating stunning contrast between pink blossoms and ancient architecture. Wild cherry trees also bloom along the stone steps.

Temperatures range from 10-18°C (50-64°F)—ideal for climbing. Mornings and evenings remain cool, so bring a jacket. Golden Week sees crowds, but early morning (7-8 AM) remains relatively peaceful.

### Summer (June-August) ★★★☆☆

June's rainy season brings fewer visitors, allowing quiet worship. Rain-dampened cedars are particularly beautiful, though wet steps require careful footing.

July and August temperatures reach 25-30°C (77-86°F), but cedar shade keeps the path cool—popular as a summer retreat. However, climbing generates considerable perspiration; bring at least one liter of water.

Late August through early September offers the rare opportunity to observe yamabushi training during "Aki no Mine-iri."

### Autumn (September-November) ★★★★★

Autumn is Haguro-san's most beautiful season. From mid-October through early November, autumn colors peak, creating breathtaking contrast between evergreen cedars and red-gold maple leaves.

The Five-Story Pagoda surrounded by autumn foliage is spectacular, drawing photographers from across Japan. Morning mist adds dreamlike beauty to the colorful scene.

Comfortable temperatures of 10-20°C (50-68°F) make this ideal climbing weather. Weekends during peak foliage are crowded; weekdays and early mornings offer more peaceful visits.

### Winter (December-March) ★★☆☆☆

Winter snow closes the stone steps. Access to the summit is only possible via the Haguro-san Toll Road. However, snow-covered Sanjin Gosaiden creates ethereal scenes with unique winter beauty.

From December 31 to January 1, the "Shoreisai" festival—designated an Important Intangible Folk Cultural Property—features yamabushi performing a magnificent fire ceremony from New Year's Eve through dawn.

Temperatures range from -5°C to 5°C (23-41°F); serious cold-weather gear is essential. Snow tires or chains are required for mountain access.

### Best Time Slots

**Early Morning (6-8 AM)**: Experience the most sacred atmosphere. Few visitors allow communion with forest silence. Morning mist creates especially mystical scenes.

**Late Morning (8-11 AM)**: Before tour buses arrive. Time to climb leisurely, enjoying points of interest along the way.

**Afternoon (12-3 PM)**: Peak crowding with group tours.

**Late Afternoon (3-5 PM)**: Western sun through cedar groves creates magical golden light.
