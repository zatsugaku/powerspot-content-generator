# Tsukubasan Shrine | Complete Guide to Ibaraki's Sacred Power Spot【Matchmaking, Twin Peaks, Access & Area Info】

Located in Tsukuba City, Ibaraki Prefecture, Tsukubasan Shrine sits on the slopes of the sacred Mount Tsukuba, overlooking the Kanto Plain, and boasts approximately 3,000 years of history. Praised since ancient times as "Fuji in the West, Tsukuba in the East," this venerable sanctuary enshrines the famous mountain—celebrated in the Man'yoshu poetry anthology—as its sacred body. Approximately one million worshippers visit annually, making it one of the Kanto region's premier power spots.

The principal deities are "Tsukuba-no-Otoko-no-Okami" (Izanagi-no-Mikoto) and "Tsukuba-no-Onna-no-Okami" (Izanami-no-Mikoto), who dwell on the mountain's twin peaks. As these are the divine couple who gave birth to the Japanese islands according to mythology, the shrine is particularly renowned for blessings of matchmaking and marital harmony.

Upon entering the grounds, visitors are immediately struck by the "Goshinboku" sacred tree—a great cedar approximately 800 years old. This giant with a trunk circumference of about 9 meters commands overwhelming presence. Behind rises Mount Tsukuba's distinctive twin peaks, with the beautiful silhouettes of Nantai-san (871m) and Nyotai-san (877m) glowing with divine radiance. Taking the cable car or ropeway to the summit allows visitors to worship at the main halls on the peaks while enjoying panoramic views of the Kanto Plain.

## The Allure of This Sacred Site

### History and Origins

Tsukubasan Shrine's founding dates back to the era of Emperor Sujin, the 10th emperor (around 97 BCE), giving it approximately 3,000 years of history as one of the Kanto region's oldest shrines. Mount Tsukuba itself has been worshipped as a sacred body and has gathered faith as a "Mountain of the Gods" since ancient times.

The Man'yoshu poetry anthology contains 25 poems about Mount Tsukuba, revealing how special this mountain was to ancient Japanese people. Particularly famous is the poem "From the peak of Tsukuba flows the Minanogawa river of man and woman / Love accumulates to become a deep pool," which likens the merging of streams from Nantai-san and Nyotai-san to romantic love.

During the Heian period, "Tsukubasan-ji Temple" was established, and the mountain flourished as a sacred site of Shinbutsu-shugo (syncretism of Shinto and Buddhism). From the Kamakura period onward, it received deep reverence from warrior clans. After Tokugawa Ieyasu entered the Kanto region, he donated 500 koku of temple lands to Tsukubasan Shrine. The current worship hall was donated by the third shogun Tokugawa Iemitsu in 1633 and is designated an Important Cultural Property of Japan.

Due to the separation of Shinto and Buddhism in the Meiji era, Tsukubasan-ji Temple was abolished, resulting in the current form of Tsukubasan Shrine. However, traces of the Shinbutsu-shugo era can still be seen throughout the grounds, creating a unique atmosphere.

### Architecture and Natural Features

Tsukubasan Shrine's buildings are known for their architecture incorporating the ornate Momoyama style. The worship hall, donated by Tokugawa Iemitsu, is particularly noteworthy, with its elaborate polychrome carvings and gold leaf decorations creating a magnificent structure. The main halls are located on the summits of Nantai-san and Nyotai-san respectively, accessible by hiking or cable car.

The "Goshinboku" sacred tree in the grounds is a great cedar approximately 800 years old with a trunk circumference of about 9 meters, revered as the shrine's symbol. Numerous other cedars and Japanese cypress trees several hundred years old stand throughout, forming a sacred forest.

Mount Tsukuba itself, at 877 meters, is not particularly tall, but its presence is outstanding as an isolated peak rising from the Kanto Plain. The twin peaks of Nantai-san and Nyotai-san are also called "Shiho" (Purple Peak), and their appearance dyed by sunset is exceptionally beautiful. Throughout the mountain, strange rocks and unusual stones are scattered, including natural power spots created by nature such as "Benkei Nanamodori" and "Haha-no-Tainai-Kuguri" (Passing Through Mother's Womb).

### What Makes This Spot Special

Tsukubasan Shrine's greatest feature is that the entire mountain is enshrined as a sacred body. From the worship hall at the foot to the main halls at the summit, Mount Tsukuba itself constitutes one great sacred precinct. This "Sacred Mountain Faith" is an ancient Japanese form of nature worship, and Tsukubasan Shrine is considered its representative example.

Additionally, the format of enshrining the divine couple on the two peaks of Nantai-san and Nyotai-san is rare even in Japan. This structure has made the shrine nationally famous as a power spot for matchmaking and marital harmony.

The "Gozagae-sai" festival held on April 1st and November 1st each year is Tsukubasan Shrine's largest celebration. This ceremony involves priests exchanging the divine garments between the mountain summit and foot—in spring from summit to foot, in autumn from foot to summit. Visiting during this festival is said to bestow special blessings.

## Spiritual Benefits and Effects

### Known Spiritual Benefits

Tsukubasan Shrine is known for diverse blessings due to enshrining the divine couple.

**Matchmaking and Romantic Success**: As the shrine enshrines the married deities Izanagi and Izanami, visitors seeking good connections never cease. The "Enmusubi-no-Ki" (Matchmaking Tree) within the grounds is a particularly popular power spot.

**Marital and Family Harmony**: As divine blessings of the couple known for the mythology of giving birth to the islands, the shrine is believed to have power to strengthen bonds between spouses and family members.

**Conception and Safe Childbirth**: As Izanami is a goddess who gave birth to many deities, prayers for conception and safe delivery are also said to be particularly efficacious here.

**Business Prosperity and Success**: "Tsukuba" is said to connect to "minoru" (to bear fruit), offering blessings for businesses and enterprises to bear fruit.

**Fulfillment of Wishes**: As the entire mountain is a sacred body, it is said to possess great power to embrace all manner of wishes.

### The Unique Energy of This Site

Tsukubasan Shrine is a place filled with energies of "harmony" and "connection." The harmony of yin and yang represented by Nantai-san and Nyotai-san, the union of the divine couple—as these symbolize, the shrine is said to harbor power to balance matters and connect people with one another.

The summit of Nyotai-san in particular is known both as a spectacular viewpoint overlooking the Kanto Plain and as a place where strong spiritual energy can be felt. On clear days, views extend to Mount Fuji, Tokyo Skytree, and the Pacific Ocean, allowing visitors to receive the earth's energy throughout their entire bodies.

### Visitor Testimonials

"I visited when I was exhausted from marriage hunting. When I made a wish at the Matchmaking Tree, I met my current husband three months later. I still visit every year to express gratitude." (Woman in her 30s, Tokyo)

"My husband and I worshipped while hiking together. After placing our hands together at the summit's main hall, we mysteriously felt our bond deepen. It became a wonderful memory for our 10th wedding anniversary." (Couple in their 40s, Saitama)

## Best Times to Visit

### Spring (March–May)
Cherry blossoms bloom from early to mid-April, and azaleas from late April to early May. You can enjoy watching flowers bloom progressively from foot to summit. The "Gozagae-sai" on April 1st is the year's largest festival. Comfortable temperatures of 15-22°C (59-72°F) make this ideal for hiking.
**Recommendation: ★★★★★**

### Summer (June–August)
Fresh green leaves are beautiful, and the mountain is popular as a summer retreat. The "Nagoshi-sai" festival in August offers chi-no-wa kuguri (passing through a sacred grass ring) to purify impurities. The summit is 5-6°C cooler than the foot, allowing comfortable worship even in midsummer. However, watch out for heatstroke when hiking.
**Recommendation: ★★★☆☆**

### Autumn (September–November)
The autumn foliage season from late October to mid-November is Mount Tsukuba's most beautiful time. The entire mountain is dyed in reds and yellows, and the view from the ropeway is spectacular. The "Gozagae-sai" on November 1st is also a highlight. Temperatures of 12-20°C (54-68°F) make for ideal hiking weather.

The air is clear, offering the best views from the summit. Mount Fuji can be seen clearly across the Kanto Plain. New Year's visits attract approximately 150,000 people. Temperatures of 0-10°C (32-50°F) require warm clothing. Be careful of icy hiking trails when there's snow.
**Recommendation: ★★★★☆**
