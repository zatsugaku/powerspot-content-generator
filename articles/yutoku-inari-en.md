# Yutoku Inari Shrine | Complete Guide to Saga's Grand Power Spot【One of Japan's Three Great Inari Shrines, Business Prosperity, Access & Area Info】

One of "Japan's Three Great Inari Shrines" alongside Fushimi Inari Taisha and Kasama Inari Shrine, Yutoku Inari Shrine is a magnificent sanctuary nestled in the mountains of Kashima City, Saga Prefecture. Approximately 3 million worshippers visit annually, making it second only to Dazaifu Tenmangu in Kyushu for visitor numbers. The vermillion-lacquered tower gate and main hall are so beautiful they are called "Chinzei Nikko" (the Nikko of Western Japan).

The shrine was founded in 1687 (Jokyo 4) when Mankohime, wife of Kashima Domain lord Nabeshima Naotomo, invited a divided spirit of the Inari deity from the imperial palace's prayer hall. Known for blessings of business prosperity, family fortune, and traffic safety, the shrine is affectionately called "Yutoku-san" by locals.

With spectacular views of the Ariake Sea from the stage-construction main hall reminiscent of Kyoto's Kiyomizu-dera, grounds colored by seasonal flowers, and mystical air along the path to the inner shrine—won't you refresh body and spirit at one of Kyushu's premier power spots?

## The Allure of This Sacred Site

### History and Origins

Yutoku Inari Shrine was founded in 1687 (Jokyo 4). It began when Mankohime (later known as Yutokuin), who married Kashima Domain lord Nabeshima Naotomo, invited a divided spirit of the Inari deity from the Kyoto Imperial Palace. Mankohime was the daughter of Kazanin Sadayoshi, and through her connection to the imperial court, she received special divine power.

In her later years, Mankohime took Buddhist vows and received the religious name "Yutokuin." In 1705 (Hoei 2), she passed away at age 83, but through people who admired her virtue, the shrine greatly developed as "Yutoku-san." The current shrine name "Yutoku Inari Shrine" derives from Mankohime's Buddhist name.

The principal deities are Ukanomitama-no-Okami, Omiyame-no-Okami, and Sarutahiko-no-Okami. As the deity of rice, they bring abundant harvests and are worshipped as a god of business prosperity.

### Architecture and Natural Features

Yutoku Inari Shrine's greatest highlight is its gorgeously decorated shrine buildings with complete lacquer coating. The tower gate stands magnificently at approximately 18m tall, with naruto (whirlpool) carvings on all four sides. Passing through this gate reveals vermillion corridors and the main hall built on the mountainside.

The main hall features "stage construction" similar to Kyoto's Kiyomizu-dera, built at a height of approximately 18m above ground. The view of the Ariake Sea and Saga Plain from this stage is spectacular—so beautiful it's praised as "Chinzei Nikko." The current shrine buildings were reconstructed in 1957 (Showa 32), faithfully reproducing traditional architectural styles.

Approximately 50,000 azaleas are planted throughout the grounds, coloring the entire slope pink from mid-April to early May. With about 300 cherry trees and magnificent autumn foliage, flowers and nature can be enjoyed throughout all seasons.

### What Makes This Spot Special

A distinctive feature of Yutoku Inari Shrine is the path to the "Oku-no-in" (inner shrine) continuing beyond the main hall. Climbing approximately 300 stone steps leads to the inner shrine near the mountain summit. Along this path, vermillion torii gates line up in rows, creating mystical scenery reminiscent of Fushimi Inari's thousand torii gates.

The view from the inner shrine is exceptional, with panoramic vistas extending to the Ariake Sea, Mount Tara, and Mount Unzen. Along the path, subsidiary shrines such as "Myobu-sha" and "Iwamoto-sha" are scattered, each said to offer different blessings.

The lively temple town is another attraction. Along the approximately 400m approach, souvenir shops and restaurants line up, where visitors can enjoy local specialties like "Inari Yokan" (sweet bean jelly) and "Goma Saba" (sesame mackerel).
