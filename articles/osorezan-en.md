# Mount Osore | Complete Guide to Aomori's Mystical Power Spot【One of Japan's Three Great Sacred Sites, Itako Spirit Mediums, Access & Area Info】

Deep within the Shimokita Peninsula lies Mount Osore (Osorezan), one of "Japan's Three Great Sacred Sites" alongside Mount Hiei and Mount Koya. Said to have been founded in 862 (Jogan 4) by the Buddhist monk Ennin (posthumously known as Jikaku Daishi), this spiritually powerful place boasts over 1,100 years of history.

The temple grounds, permeated with the smell of sulfur and featuring desolate rocky landscapes, evoke images of "the afterworld" with their distinctive scenery. The beautiful cobalt blue of Lake Usori contrasts with hellish landscapes like the "Blood Pond Hell" and "Sai no Kawara" (riverbed where children's souls gather), creating an atmosphere that truly feels like the boundary between life and death.

During the "Osorezan Grand Festival" in July and "Osorezan Autumn Pilgrimage" in October, "Itako no Kuchiyose" (spirit medium séances) are performed to call forth the spirits of the deceased, attracting pilgrims from across Japan. While access takes about 2.5 hours by car from Aomori Station, this very remoteness preserves the sacred atmosphere, keeping it separated from the secular world.

## The Allure of This Sacred Site

### History and Origins

Mount Osore was founded in 862 (Jogan 4) by Ennin, a high priest of the Tendai Buddhist sect. It is said that after returning from Tang China, Ennin was guided to this location by a divine dream and established a temple with Jizo Bodhisattva as the principal deity.

The official name is "Osorezan Bodaiji Temple," a Soto Zen temple. The principal deity, Jizo Bodhisattva, is worshipped as a buddha who saves the souls of the dead. Particularly in the Tohoku region, there is a belief that "when people die, they go to Osorezan," and this place has been treasured as a gathering place for the souls of the deceased.

The origin of the name "Osore" (meaning "fear" in Japanese) has several theories, but the most prevalent suggests it derives from the Ainu word "Usori" (meaning a hollow or bay). Lake Usori's name also comes from this origin.

### Architecture and Natural Features

Mount Osore's temple grounds cover a vast area of approximately 3.3 square kilometers, located within a caldera surrounded by outer rim mountains. The elevation is approximately 879 meters. Geothermal activity and sulfur gas emissions from volcanic activity can be seen throughout, forming the distinctive "hell" landscapes.

Within the grounds, there are said to be 136 different "hells," including "Blood Pond Hell," "Mugen (Infinite) Hell," and "Kanabori (Gold Mining) Hell." The contrast between the sulfur-whitened rock surfaces and the emerald green of Lake Usori is spectacular. Particularly, "Gokuraku-hama" (Paradise Beach) along the lake shore, with its white sand and cobalt blue water, presents beauty reminiscent of the Pure Land paradise.

The main hall, Jizo-den, was rebuilt in 1950 and stands as an imposing structure. Within the grounds are four hot spring baths (Yakushi-no-yu, Reinuki-no-yu, Furutaki-no-yu, and Hanazome-no-yu) available free to worshippers. These sulfur springs have been cherished as "sacred site baths" since ancient times.

### What Makes This Spot Special

Mount Osore's greatest distinctive feature is the "Itako no Kuchiyose" (spirit medium séances) performed here. Itako are female shamans traditional to the Tohoku region who channel the spirits of deceased loved ones and relay their messages to surviving family members. During the Grand Festival (July 20-24) and Autumn Pilgrimage (second week of October during consecutive holidays), Itako are stationed within the grounds and visitors can receive kuchiyose.

The pinwheels standing at Sai no Kawara are also one of Mount Osore's iconic scenes. Offered to comfort the spirits of children who died young, the colorful pinwheels swaying in the wind create a poignant yet beautiful sight.

Another attraction is that the 500 yen admission fee includes access to the hot spring baths. After walking through the hells, visitors can soothe their tired bodies in the sulfur waters.

## Spiritual Benefits and Effects

### Known Spiritual Benefits

**Memorial Services for the Deceased**: Mount Osore's greatest spiritual benefit. Visitors can pray for the repose of departed souls and comfort their spirits. It serves as an important place for bereaved families to find closure.

**Ancestral Veneration**: Visitors can pay respects to generations of ancestors and deepen family bonds. Especially during the Obon season, many pilgrims visit.

**Protection from Evil and Misfortune**: Jizo Bodhisattva is also worshipped as a buddha who protects people from calamities.

**Healing from Illness**: The hot springs within the grounds have long been considered effective "sacred site baths" for healing both body and mind.

**Spiritual Purification**: Walking through the desolate hell landscapes is said to help release worldly desires and attachments from one's heart.

### The Unique Energy of This Site

Mount Osore is considered a special place situated at the "boundary between life and death." Known as the place closest to the afterworld, it is said to have the power to facilitate dialogue with the deceased and prompt reflection on one's own way of living.

Many people experience a deepening appreciation for "life" precisely by becoming conscious of "death" through walking the hell trail. It is also said that receiving messages from the deceased through Itako kuchiyose gives bereaved families the strength to move forward.

The contrast between the hell areas with their sulfur gas emissions and the peaceful scenery of Paradise Beach symbolizes both suffering and salvation. Experiencing this contrast is said to give people the strength to overcome life's hardships.

### Visitor Testimonials

"I visited wanting to meet my deceased mother. When I heard my mother's words through the Itako's kuchiyose, I couldn't stop crying. 'Don't worry, you're doing well'—these words brought me closure and allowed me to face forward again." (Woman in her 50s, Tokyo)

"I visited as a tourist but was overwhelmed by the contrast between the desolate hell landscapes and the beauty of Paradise Beach. I deeply felt the preciousness of being alive, and my approach to work changed after returning home." (Man in his 40s, Miyagi Prefecture)

## Visitor Reviews and Experiences

**"Reunion with My Late Father"** (Woman in her 60s, Akita Prefecture)
"It took me three years after my father passed to finally visit Mount Osore. During the Grand Festival, I asked an Itako for kuchiyose, and words that were so characteristically my father came through one after another. 'Don't worry, you're doing well.' I sobbed at those words. On the way home, I realized my heart felt lighter."

**"My View of Life Changed"** (Man in his 30s, Kanagawa Prefecture)
"I visited as a casual tourist but was overwhelmed by the gap between the desolate hell scenery and the beauty of Paradise Beach. Seeing the pinwheels at Sai no Kawara made me keenly feel both the fragility and preciousness of life. The sulfur smell bothered me at first, but by the time I left, I had a sense of being 'purified.'"

**"A Place to Quietly Remember the Departed"** (Woman in her 40s, Aomori Prefecture)
"I visited on a weekday in September, avoiding the Grand Festival. There were hardly any people, and I could slowly walk around while remembering my late grandmother. The hot spring was practically private, and I was healed in both body and spirit."

## Frequently Asked Questions

A: Reservations are not accepted. During the Grand Festival and Autumn Pilgrimage periods, visitors must wait in line at the site. During peak times, waits can reach 2-3 hours.

A: No. Mount Osore is only open from May 1 to October 31, and is closed during winter.

**Q: Is it suitable for children?**
A: Worship is possible, but some children may be frightened by the sulfur gas and desolate landscapes. Some parts of the hell trail have unstable footing, so caution is needed with small children.

**Q: Is there parking?**
A: Free parking for approximately 300 vehicles is available. During the Grand Festival, it gets crowded, so early arrival is recommended.

**Q: What do I need to bring for the hot springs?**

## Summary

Mount Osore is a sacred site with over 1,100 years of history as one of Japan's Three Great Sacred Sites. The desolate "hell" landscapes where sulfur gas rises and the beautiful cobalt blue of Lake Usori create scenery that truly feels like the boundary between this world and the next.

Known for spiritual benefits of memorial services and ancestral veneration, the "Itako no Kuchiyose" performed during the Grand Festival and Autumn Pilgrimage periods provides a special experience for those seeking dialogue with departed loved ones. Many visitors report that becoming conscious of death through walking the hell trail paradoxically deepens their appreciation for life.

The grounds contain four hot springs accessible with just the admission fee, allowing visitors to purify body and mind in the sulfur waters—another major attraction.

While only open from May to October, this power spot in Aomori's Shimokita Peninsula is well worth combining with regional sightseeing for at least one visit. We recommend it not only for those wishing to commemorate the departed but also for anyone wanting to reflect on their own way of living.
