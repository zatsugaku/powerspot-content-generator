# Lake Kawaguchi | Complete Guide to Yamanashi's Power Spot【Mount Fuji, Inverted Fuji, Access & Area Info】

Located in Fujikawaguchiko Town, Minamitsuru District, Yamanashi Prefecture, Lake Kawaguchi is a beautiful lake with the longest shoreline among the Fuji Five Lakes. At approximately 830 meters elevation, with a circumference of about 21 kilometers and maximum depth of about 15 meters, the "Inverted Fuji" (Sakasa Fuji) reflected on the lake surface is an iconic Japanese landscape that draws tourists from around the world.

Long flourishing as a base for Mount Fuji worship, shrines and temples including Kawaguchi Asama Shrine dot the lakeside. This place where Mount Fuji's spiritual power and the lake's energy intersect is known as a power spot for purification of body and mind and wish fulfillment.

Cherry blossoms and Mount Fuji in spring, fresh greenery and lavender in summer, autumn foliage in fall, and snow-capped views in winter—Lake Kawaguchi, reflecting the seasonal faces of Mount Fuji, is one of Japan's premier power spots where natural beauty and mystical energy merge.

## The Allure of This Sacred Site

### History and Origins

Lake Kawaguchi's history is intertwined with Mount Fuji worship. In ancient times, it was called "Mikami no Umi" (Lake of the Gods), a sacred place where ascetic practitioners purified themselves before climbing Mount Fuji.

During the Heian period, Asama worship venerating Mount Fuji as a sacred deity flourished, and Kawaguchi Asama Shrine, built in 864 (Jogan 6) to pacify Mount Fuji following its eruption, became the center of faith in this area. The "Oshi" culture preserved at the shrine—a unique religious practice of guiding pilgrims up Mount Fuji and providing lodging—was registered as a component of the World Cultural Heritage "Fujisan" in 2013.

During the Edo period, confraternities called "Fujiko" dedicated to Mount Fuji worship spread nationwide, and Lake Kawaguchi prospered as a starting point for Mount Fuji climbing, bustling with many pilgrims. Even today, the Oshi houses along the lakeside retain traces of that era.

From the Meiji period onward, the area also developed as a tourist destination. It was designated as part of Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park in 1950, and in 2013, registered as World Cultural Heritage under "Fujisan—Sacred Place and Source of Artistic Inspiration," with Lake Kawaguchi as one of its component sites.

### Architecture and Natural Features

Lake Kawaguchi is the second largest of the Fuji Five Lakes and has the longest shoreline (approximately 21 kilometers). The lake surface elevation is about 830 meters, area is 5.48 square kilometers, and maximum depth is about 15 meters.

The lake's greatest feature is its beautiful reflection of Mount Fuji. Particularly on windless early mornings, the "Inverted Fuji" reflected on the lake surface is an iconic Japanese landscape depicted even in Katsushika Hokusai's ukiyo-e prints. Excellent viewpoints including Ubuyagasaki and Oishi Park are scattered around the lake.

The Kawaguchi-ko Ohashi Bridge spans the northern shore, and from this 500-meter-long bridge, visitors can enjoy a grand panorama of Mount Fuji and the lake. When opened in 1971 it was a toll bridge, but passage is now free.

Shrines related to Mount Fuji worship, including Kawaguchi Asama Shrine and Fuji Omuro Sengen Shrine, are enshrined along the lakeside. Particularly, the giant cedar grove at Kawaguchi Asama Shrine, some over 1,200 years old, is known as a powerful power spot.

### What Makes This Spot Special

What sets Lake Kawaguchi apart from other lakes is its "unity with Mount Fuji."

Mount Fuji has been revered as a sacred peak since ancient times, and its spiritual power is said to extend to the surrounding lakes. Lake Kawaguchi is a dammed lake formed by Mount Fuji's volcanic activity, literally "connected by water" to Mount Fuji. Its spiritual energy is said to be extremely powerful.

Additionally, the "Inverted Fuji" can only be seen under special conditions—when there is no wind and the air is clear. There is a tradition that those who see the Inverted Fuji will have their wishes granted.

Oshino Hakkai, where Mount Fuji's underground water springs forth, is also nearby, making this an area with particularly strong water energy. It could be called an ideal power spot for those seeking purification and healing.
