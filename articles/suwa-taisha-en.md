# Suwa Taisha | Complete Guide to Nagano's Ancient Power Spot【Onbashira Festival, Four Shrine Pilgrimage, Access & Area Info】

As one of Japan's oldest shrines, Suwa Taisha serves as the head shrine of approximately 25,000 Suwa shrines throughout the nation. Its unique configuration of four sanctuaries—two upper and two lower shrines—positioned on opposite sides of Lake Suwa speaks to the profound faith maintained since ancient times. The "Onbashira Festival," held once every seven years, is renowned worldwide as one of Japan's Three Great Strange Festivals.

The "Four Shrine Pilgrimage" visiting both Upper Shrines (Maemiya and Honmiya) and both Lower Shrines (Harumiya and Akimiya) is popular as a way to fully receive the power that fills the Suwa region. The ancient form of worship that venerates nature itself as the sacred body, without traditional main halls, preserves the original essence of Japanese Shinto to this day. About 2 hours by limited express from Tokyo, why not embark on a journey to purify body and mind at this sacred site embraced by Shinshu's magnificent nature?

## The Allure of This Sacred Site

### History and Origins

Suwa Taisha's founding dates back to the age of the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, Japan's oldest historical chronicles. The principal deities are Takeminakata-no-Kami and Yasakatome-no-Kami. Takeminakata-no-Kami, a son of Okuninushi-no-Mikoto, is said to have journeyed from Izumo to Suwa, where he developed the land.

The shrine received imperial veneration from ancient times and is recorded as a "Myojin Taisha" (prestigious shrine) in the Engishiki Jinmyocho registry. It attracted deep faith from Sengoku period warriors including Takeda Shingen, and "Suwa Myojin" was revered as a god of war and victory. Takeda Shingen's profound devotion to Suwa Taisha and his famous "Furinkazan" (Wind, Forest, Fire, Mountain) battle banner are well documented.

During the Edo period, worship of "Osuwa-sama" spread widely among common people, and Suwa shrines were established throughout Japan. Today, approximately 2 million visitors come annually to pray for abundant harvests, family safety, and good fortune.

### Architecture and Natural Features

Suwa Taisha's most distinctive feature is the absence of a main hall (honden). Kamisha Honmiya venerates Mount Moriya behind it, Kamisha Maemiya venerates the Mimuro, and both Shimosha Harumiya and Akimiya venerate sacred trees as their divine bodies. This represents the primordial form of nature worship that predates the development of shrine architecture.

Within Kamisha Honmiya's grounds stands a giant zelkova tree estimated at approximately 1,000 years old, its presence overwhelming visitors. The worship hall (haiden), donated by Tokugawa Ieyasu, is designated an Important Cultural Property. The "Onbashira" pillars standing at the four corners are massive fir trees hauled down from the mountains during the septennial Onbashira Festival, serving as the shrine's symbols.

Shimosha Akimiya features a sacred tree called "Neirinozugi" (Sleeping Cedar), so named because its branch tips appear to droop and sleep at night. The "Goshinyu" hot spring bubbling within the grounds testifies to Suwa's identity as a hot spring region.

### What Makes This Spot Special

What makes Suwa Taisha truly extraordinary is the "Onbashira Festival." Held in years of the Tiger and Monkey (every seven years by traditional counting), this festival features the "Kiotoshi" ceremony where massive fir trees cut from the mountains are hauled by human power and sent sliding down steep slopes—a ritual known for being life-risking.

The "Omiwatari" phenomenon visible on Lake Suwa in winter is equally mystical. When the lake surface freezes completely, ice ridges up creating crack-like patterns, believed to be traces of the deity crossing the lake. Rituals to witness this occurrence and divine fortunes continue to this day.

Each of the four shrines possesses its own distinct atmosphere: Kamisha Honmiya's solemnity, Kamisha Maemiya's tranquility, Shimosha Harumiya's elegance, and Shimosha Akimiya's magnificence—each visit reveals a different face.

## Best Times to Visit

### Spring (March–May)
Cherry blossom season, particularly mid to late April, colors the grounds beautifully. As the name "Harumiya" (Spring Shrine) suggests, this shrine is especially beautiful during this period. Temperatures of 10-18°C (50-64°F) are ideal for strolling. Golden Week is crowded; weekdays recommended.
**Recommendation: ★★★★☆**

### Summer (June–August)
The Lake Suwa Fireworks Festival (August 15) draws approximately 400,000 visitors. The cool highland climate allows worship combined with escaping summer heat. Temperatures 20-28°C (68-82°F). Obon period is particularly crowded.
**Recommendation: ★★★★☆**

### Autumn (September–November)
Autumn foliage season runs from late October to early November. Kamisha Honmiya's fall colors are spectacular, with beautiful contrast between the Onbashira pillars and autumn leaves. Temperatures of 8-18°C (46-64°F) are ideal for worship.
**Recommendation: ★★★★★**

### Winter (December–February)
The mysterious "Omiwatari" phenomenon may be visible from late January to February. Temperatures can drop below -10°C (14°F) during the coldest period. Snowy landscape worship is mystical but requires thorough cold-weather preparation. Approximately 200,000 visitors come for New Year worship.
**Recommendation: ★★★☆☆**

### Best Times of Day

**Early Morning (6:00-8:00 AM)**: Few visitors, allowing worship in crisp, fresh air. Kamisha Honmiya is especially recommended in early morning.

**Morning (9:00 AM-Noon)**: Amulet offices are open, ideal for obtaining goshuin and charms.

**Afternoon (2:00-4:00 PM)**: For the four shrine pilgrimage, starting from the Lower Shrines in the afternoon is efficient. Akimiya at dusk is exceptional.

### Basic Worship Etiquette

1. **Passing Through the Torii**: Bow once before entering and walk along the edge. At Suwa Taisha, avoiding the center—the "deity's path"—is particularly important.

## Visitor Reviews and Experiences

**"The Four Shrine Pilgrimage Helped Organize My Life"** (Man in his 50s, Saitama)
"Before retirement, I did the four shrine pilgrimage to contemplate my future. Sensing different atmospheres at each shrine, I renewed my determination at Kamisha Honmiya and finished with a peaceful heart at Shimosha Akimiya. By the time I left, my thoughts had organized themselves, and I felt positive about the future."

**"Overwhelmed by the Onbashira's Presence"** (Woman in her 30s, Osaka)
"The actual Onbashira pillars have far more presence than photos suggest. Feeling the warmth of the wood when I touched it and sensing the history of festivals continuing for hundreds of years moved me deeply."

**"The Perfect Trip Combining Hot Springs"** (Couple in their 40s, Aichi)
"We stayed at a hot spring inn by Lake Suwa after worship. The combination of shrines, hot springs, and delicious sake was perfect. We want to return in different seasons."

## Summary

As one of Japan's oldest shrines with over 2,000 years of history, Suwa Taisha is Shinshu's premier power spot. Its primordial worship form venerating nature as the divine body without traditional main halls, the septennial Onbashira Festival, and the mystical winter Omiwatari phenomenon give it unique attractions found nowhere else.

Each of the four shrines possesses its own distinct atmosphere, and the four shrine pilgrimage—strengthening "resolve" at the Upper Shrines and gaining the power of "action" at the Lower Shrines—is ideal for those at life's crossroads.
