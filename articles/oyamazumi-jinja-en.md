# Oyamazumi Shrine | Complete Guide to Ehime's Premier Power Spot【National Treasures, Victory Blessings, Access & Area Info】

Standing majestically on Omishima Island in the Seto Inland Sea, Oyamazumi Shrine serves as the head shrine of approximately 10,000 Yamazumi and Mishima shrines throughout Japan. With a history spanning over 1,400 years since its founding in 594 CE during Emperor Suiko's reign, this venerable sanctuary bears the distinguished title of "Nihon Sokoku Chinshu" (Guardian Deity of All Japan), having received profound reverence from the imperial court since ancient times.

The principal deity, Oyamazumi-no-Kami (the Great Mountain Spirit), is the elder brother of Amaterasu, the Sun Goddess, and has been worshipped as the god of mountains, seas, and warfare. The shrine's treasure hall houses an astounding collection of national treasure and important cultural property armor and weapons—approximately 80% of all nationally designated treasure-class military equipment in Japan is preserved here. Legendary warriors including Minamoto no Yoritomo, Minamoto no Yoshitsune, and Kono Michinobu came here to pray for victory in battle, dedicating their armor and weapons to the shrine.

Upon entering the sacred grounds, visitors are immediately struck by the presence of the Great Camphor Tree, said to be approximately 2,600 years old. This majestic giant, with a trunk circumference of 11 meters and height of about 16 meters, radiates an awe-inspiring aura. Touching it is believed to bestow blessings of longevity. Enveloped in sea breezes and verdant greenery, this divine sanctuary quietly soothes the hearts of all who visit.

## The Allure of This Sacred Site

### History and Origins

Oyamazumi Shrine's founding dates to 594 CE during Emperor Suiko's reign, when the deity Oyamazumi-no-Kami was enshrined on Omishima Island. The principal deity is the child of Izanagi-no-Mikoto and Izanami-no-Mikoto, and as the elder brother of Amaterasu, holds an exceptionally high rank among the gods.

During the Nara period, the shrine received the title "Nihon Sokoku Chinshu" (Guardian Deity of All Japan) from the imperial court and has been venerated as the ichinomiya (first shrine) of Iyo Province. It was listed as a major shrine (myojin taisha) in the Engishiki Jinmyocho compiled during the Heian period, attesting to its prestigious status.

From the medieval period onward, faith in the shrine as a deity of war intensified, with many warlords including the Minamoto and Taira clans visiting to pray for military victory. Minamoto no Yoritomo famously dedicated sacred treasures before raising his forces in Izu, while Minamoto no Yoshitsune reportedly paid respects before the Battle of Yashima. During the Kamakura period, the shrine became the guardian deity of the Kono naval forces, gathering worship as the protector of maritime traffic across the strategically important Seto Inland Sea.

### Architecture and Natural Features

Oyamazumi Shrine's buildings center on the main hall built in the sangensha-nagare-zukuri style, with the worship hall, sacred gate, and corridors arranged in orderly fashion. The current main hall, rebuilt in 1602, is designated an Important Cultural Property of Japan. The hinoki bark roof and vermilion-painted pillars create a beautiful contrast with the surrounding greenery.

The most impressive feature of the grounds is the Great Camphor Tree, designated a natural monument. Approximately 2,600 years old with a trunk circumference of 11 meters and height of about 16 meters, this giant welcomes worshippers with breathtaking presence. A small shrine at its base has become popular as a power spot for longevity and health.

The grounds contain 38 giant camphor trees, each several hundred to over a thousand years old. The entire shrine is wrapped in a camphor forest, filled with purified air. The "Ochi-no-Mikoto Otaue no Kusu" (Camphor Planted by Prince Ochi) is said to be approximately 2,600 years old and is revered as a sacred tree second only to the Great Camphor.

### What Makes This Spot Special

Oyamazumi Shrine's greatest distinction is its collection of armor and weapons designated as national treasures and important cultural properties. The adjacent "Oyamazumi Shrine Treasure Hall" houses approximately 600 pieces of military equipment, including 8 national treasures and 76 important cultural properties. The fact that approximately 80% of all nationally designated treasure-class military equipment in Japan is gathered here speaks to how deeply this shrine was revered by warriors.

Particularly famous are the "Akaito Odoshi Yoroi" (Red-Laced Armor), said to have been dedicated by Minamoto no Yoshitsune, and the "Murasakiaya Odoshi Yoroi" (Purple Twill-Laced Armor) dedicated by Prince Morinaga—both designated national treasures. These armors are in excellent preservation condition, allowing visitors to witness craftsmanship from 800 years ago up close.

Additionally, Oyamazumi Shrine is located near the center of the Shimanami Kaido cycling route and is known as a sacred place for cyclists. A stone monument reading "Sacred Ground for Cyclists" stands on the grounds, and many visitors arrive by bicycle.

## Best Times to Visit

### Spring (March–May)
Late March to early April, when the shrine's cherry blossoms reach full bloom, is especially recommended. Approximately 40 Somei Yoshino cherry trees color the grounds, creating a spectacular scene alongside the Great Camphor. Comfortable temperatures of 15-22°C (59-72°F) make this ideal for combining with Shimanami Kaido cycling. The Spring Grand Festival on April 22nd features mikoshi processions and lion dances.
**Recommendation: ★★★★★**

### Summer (June–August)
Mid-June to early July is the rainy season, but the green of the camphor trees glistening in rain is beautiful, and fewer visitors allow for peaceful worship. July and August bring temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), but the camphor forest provides shade that makes it surprisingly cool. The Kangensai Festival in August features gagaku court music performances.
**Recommendation: ★★★☆☆**

### Autumn (September–November)
October to November offers the most pleasant temperatures of 15-20°C (59-68°F). While autumn colors are limited, the contrast between the evergreen camphor trees and autumn sky is beautiful. The Autumn Grand Festival on November 3rd is the year's most festive day, featuring yabusame (mounted archery) ceremonies.
**Recommendation: ★★★★★**

### Winter (December–February)
Thanks to the mild Seto Inland Sea climate, many days remain relatively comfortable even in winter. Temperatures around 5-10°C (41-50°F) require warm clothing but are manageable. Fewer visitors allow for worship in peaceful silence. January 1st-3rd brings approximately 100,000 New Year's worshippers.
**Recommendation: ★★★☆☆**

### Best Times of Day

**Early Morning (6:00-8:00 AM)**: Few visitors, allowing you to enjoy the Great Camphor bathed in morning light to yourself. Worship in the purified morning air is exceptional.

**Morning (9:00-11:00 AM)**: Recommended for visiting when the treasure hall opens (8:30 AM). Allows for unhurried viewing.

**Late Afternoon (4:00-5:00 PM)**: The shrine buildings and camphor forest illuminated by western light are beautiful, making this an ideal time for photography.
