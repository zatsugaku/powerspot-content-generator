# Lake Towada | Complete Guide to Aomori's Mystical Power Spot【Caldera Lake, Oirase Gorge, Access & Area Info】

Straddling the border between Aomori and Akita Prefectures, Lake Towada is a double caldera lake formed by volcanic activity approximately 200,000 years ago. Its mystical cobalt blue surface captivates the hearts of all who visit.

This quintessentially Japanese lake, with a circumference of approximately 46 kilometers and maximum depth of 327 meters, has been revered as a "Lake of the Gods" since ancient times. Towada Shrine, nestled on the lakeshore, holds legends of dragon deities, with the lake itself worshipped as a sacred object.

Together with the Oirase Gorge—designated a Special Place of Scenic Beauty and Natural Monument—this sacred site forms the heart of Towada-Hachimantai National Park, continuing to heal visitors with spectacular seasonal scenery and profound silence. Crystal-clear air, a mirror-like lake surface, and the mystical presence unchanged since ancient times—Lake Towada is the ultimate power spot for rejuvenating the weary modern soul.

## The Allure of This Sacred Site

### History and Origins

Lake Towada's formation dates back approximately 200,000 years. Repeated volcanic activity caused the mountaintop to collapse, forming a massive caldera. Around 15,000 years ago, the present lake's original form took shape, and it has existed as a mystical blue lake ever since.

The origin of the name "Towada" has several theories, with the most credible suggesting it derives from the Ainu word "Towatara" meaning "lake with many rocks." Another theory proposes it means "Lake of the Gods" in the language of the Emishi people who once ruled this region—either way, the area has clearly been recognized as sacred since ancient times.

Towada Shrine, situated on the lakeshore, is said to have been founded in 807 CE (Daido 2) by Sakanoue no Tamuramaro. The principal deity is Yamato Takeru no Mikoto, but locally, dragon deity worship also runs deep with reverence for "Seiryu Daigongen" (Great Azure Dragon), and the lake itself is venerated as a sacred dwelling place of the dragon god.

The famous "Towada Legend" tells of a monk named Nansobo who battled Hachiro-Taro, the master of Lake Hachirogata, and upon victory became the master of Lake Towada. This legend continues to be passed down as an important folk tale enhancing the lake's mystical nature.

### Architecture and Natural Features

Lake Towada has a rare structure as a "double caldera lake." Within a large caldera, an even smaller caldera (called Nakanoumi or "inner lake") has formed, boasting Japan's third deepest maximum depth of 327 meters.

The lake's transparency of approximately 12 meters is remarkably high, and its mystical surface shifts colors from emerald green to cobalt blue depending on the light. The secret to this beautiful blue lies in the extremely low plankton content—hence its name as a "Lake of the Gods" with such pristine clarity.

Standing on the lakeshore is the "Maiden Statue." This bronze sculpture, the final work of poet Kotaro Takamura, is beloved as Lake Towada's symbol. It was created in 1953 to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the national park designation.

Additionally, the Oirase Gorge—the only river flowing from Lake Towada—spans approximately 14 kilometers of stream beauty and is designated a Special Place of Scenic Beauty and Natural Monument. The scenery woven by countless waterfalls including Choshi Otaki Falls, moss-covered rocks, and virgin forests of beech and Japanese Judas trees draws tourists from around the world as one of Japan's premier gorge landscapes.

### What Makes This Spot Special

What sets Lake Towada apart from other lakes is its "mystical quality" and "profound silence."

Standing on the lakeshore, visitors are enveloped in a sensation of time standing still. On windless days, the lake surface becomes a perfect mirror, reflecting the surrounding mountains and sky in what's called "Inverted Towada." This sight deeply moves visitors' hearts, with many reporting that "it changed my perspective on life."

Furthermore, Lake Towada has long been known as a spiritual power spot as the "lake where dragon deities dwell." The "Uranba" (divination spot) at Towada Shrine in particular draws many worshippers as a sacred place to make wishes to the dragon deity.

## Best Times to Visit

### Spring (April–May)
Cherry blossoms begin blooming from late April through mid-May. Fresh green season is also beautiful, with exceptional contrast between remaining snow on mountains and young leaves. Golden Week is crowded, so weekdays after mid-May are recommended.
**Recommendation: ★★★★☆**

### Summer (June–August)
The season when Oirase Gorge's greenery is most beautiful. Hiking while bathing in waterfall negative ions is wonderful. The Obon period in August is crowded, but viewing summer Lake Towada from the cruise boat is refreshing.

### Autumn (September–November)
Peak autumn foliage runs mid to late October. Lakeside trees turn red and yellow, with "inverted autumn colors" reflected in the lake surface being breathtakingly beautiful. The most popular season for both Lake Towada and Oirase Gorge. Crowding is certain, but early morning visits let you enjoy the dreamlike scenery alone.
**Recommendation: ★★★★★**

### Winter (December–March)
Mystical snow-covered scenery spreads across the landscape. During February's "Lake Towada Winter Story," the lakeshore is decorated with illuminations and fireworks. Winter Lake Towada has few tourists, ideal for those seeking solitude.

## Visitor Reviews and Experiences

**"Speechless Beauty"** (Woman in her 50s, Kanagawa Prefecture)
"I visited during autumn foliage season. The autumn colors reflected in the lake were so beautiful I couldn't move. It felt like the dragon deity truly exists—such a mystical atmosphere."

**"Strange Experience with Oyori Fortune"** (Woman in her 30s, Iwate Prefecture)
"I did Oyori fortune telling at the divination spot. When I floated it with my job change wish, it drifted out to sea without any wind and slowly sank. Three months later, I received an offer from the company I wanted. It may be coincidence, but I believe it was the dragon deity's blessing."
