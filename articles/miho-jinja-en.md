# Miho Shrine | Complete Guide to Shimane's Sacred Power Spot【Ebisu Worship, Business Prosperity, Access & Area Info】

Standing at the eastern tip of the Shimane Peninsula in the port town of Mihonoseki, Miho Shrine serves as the head shrine of approximately 3,000 Ebisu shrines throughout Japan. The principal deity, Kotoshironushi-no-Kami, is the son of Okuninushi (the deity of Izumo Taisha) and has been worshipped since ancient times as "Ebisu-sama"—the god of business prosperity and fishing abundance.

While the exact founding date remains unknown, the shrine appears in the "Izumo no Kuni Fudoki" compiled during the Nara period (733 CE), confirming a history of at least 1,300 years. A tradition called "Ryomairi" (dual pilgrimage) holds that visiting both Izumo Taisha and Miho Shrine doubles the blessings received, leading many pilgrims to journey to both sacred sites.

Upon entering the grounds, visitors are immediately struck by the distinctive shrine architecture known as "Miho-zukuri." Based on the Taisha-zukuri style, this rare configuration features two main halls standing side by side, designated as an Important Cultural Property of Japan. Before you stretches the tranquil Miho Bay, while behind rises Mount Aoshimagaki, creating a landscape of divine beauty. Every morning at 8:30 AM, the "Asa-mike-sai" (Morning Food Offering Ceremony) is performed, offering visitors a precious opportunity to witness ancient Shinto rituals and shrine maiden dances free of charge—a genuine encounter with the world of Japanese mythology.

## The Allure of This Sacred Site

### History and Origins

While Miho Shrine's exact founding date is unknown, it was recorded as "Miho-sha" in the Izumo no Kuni Fudoki compiled in 733 CE, confirming a history spanning at least 1,300 years.

The principal deity Kotoshironushi-no-Kami is the son of Okuninushi (the deity of Izumo Taisha) and played a crucial role in the mythology of "Kuniyuzuri" (the transfer of the land). According to legend, Kotoshironushi was fishing at Mihonoseki when approached by messengers from Amaterasu regarding the transfer of the land, whereupon he hid himself beneath the sea. From this mythological episode, Kotoshironushi became identified with "Ebisu-sama," worshipped as a god of good fortune who brings the bounty of the sea.

The other principal deity, Mihotsuhime-no-Mikoto, is a daughter of Takamimusubi-no-Kami of Takamagahara (the High Plain of Heaven) and consort of Okuninushi. She is revered as a goddess of agriculture who governs rice cultivation, as well as a deity of marital harmony.

From the medieval period onward, the shrine flourished alongside Mihonoseki's prosperity as a crucial maritime hub, receiving devoted worship from kitamaebune ship owners and merchants. During the Edo period, it enjoyed the patronage of the Matsudaira clan, lords of Matsue Domain. The current shrine buildings were reconstructed in 1813.

### Architecture and Natural Features

Miho Shrine's buildings feature a unique architectural style called "Miho-zukuri," designated as an Important Cultural Property of Japan. Based on the "Taisha-zukuri" style represented by Izumo Taisha, the distinctive structure consists of two main halls standing side by side—the right hall enshrining Kotoshironushi-no-Kami and the left enshrining Mihotsuhime-no-Mikoto—connected by the "Shozoku-no-ma" (Robing Room).

The cypress bark roofs with chigi (crossed finials) and katsuogi (horizontal roof logs) are beautiful, and the walls feature polychrome carvings. The dragon and phoenix carvings on the front of the main halls are particularly noteworthy. The worship hall, rebuilt in 1928, welcomes visitors with its impressive irimoya-zukuri (hip-and-gable) construction.

Behind the shrine rises Mount Aoshimagaki, revered as sacred ground that served as a stage for mythology. From the shrine grounds, visitors can enjoy panoramic views of Miho Bay, and on clear days can see as far as the Oki Islands. Descending the stone steps of the approach path brings you immediately to the active fishing port, where working boats come and go in a lively scene.

### What Makes This Spot Special

Miho Shrine's greatest attraction is the "Asa-mike-sai" (Morning Food Offering Ceremony) performed daily. Every morning at 8:30 AM for approximately 20 minutes, priests perform ancient rituals while shrine maidens offer sacred dances. General visitors can observe free of charge, providing a precious opportunity to experience traditions maintained for over 1,300 years.

The "Ryomairi" (dual pilgrimage) combining visits to both Izumo Taisha and Miho Shrine is known as Shimane's premier power spot circuit. By praying to both Okuninushi (the father deity) and Kotoshironushi (the son deity), blessings are said to be doubled—particularly popular among those seeking business prosperity and success.

Within the grounds, the "Okage-no-Ido" (Well of Blessings) has quietly gained popularity as a power spot where wishes come true. Additionally, Miho Shrine is known as a shrine of "musical instruments," with a strong tradition of instrument dedications. The "Shuzoko" (Storage Building) within the grounds houses approximately 850 dedicated instruments, viewable by appointment.

## Best Times to Visit

### Spring (March–May)
The cherry blossom season in April beautifully colors the grounds. Comfortable temperatures of 15-20°C (59-68°F) make this pleasant for visiting, and as the beginning of tourist season, it's relatively uncrowded. The "Aoshimagaki Shinji" on April 7th is the shrine's largest festival, featuring ceremonies reenacting the Kuniyuzuri mythology.
**Recommendation: ★★★★☆**

### Summer (June–August)
Summer brings pleasant sea breezes and stunning views of Miho Bay. The "Miho Shrine Summer Festival" in August draws local crowds. Temperatures reach 28-32°C (82-90°F), but the seaside location keeps it relatively cool. Morning worship during the cool Asa-mike-sai time is recommended.
**Recommendation: ★★★☆☆**

### Autumn (September–November)
October to November offers the most pleasant temperatures of 15-22°C (59-72°F). While autumn colors are limited, the clear air enhances the beauty of Miho Bay and Mount Aoshimagaki views. The "Morotabune Shinji" on December 3rd is designated an Important Intangible Folk Cultural Property and is worth witnessing.
**Recommendation: ★★★★★**

### Winter (December–February)
Overcast skies typical of the Sea of Japan coast are common, but the rough winter sea combined with the shrine's solemn atmosphere creates a unique appeal. Temperatures of 5-10°C (41-50°F) require warm clothing. Fewer visitors make this ideal for peaceful worship. January 1st-3rd brings approximately 30,000 New Year's visitors.
**Recommendation: ★★★☆☆**

### Best Times of Day

**Early Morning (8:00-8:30 AM)**: Timing your visit with the Asa-mike-sai is highly recommended. Arrive before the 8:30 AM ceremony start to worship in a solemn atmosphere.

**Morning (9:00-11:00 AM)**: After the Asa-mike-sai, enjoy leisurely exploration of the grounds in the refreshing air. The amulet office is open for charms and goshuin.
