## The Allure of This Sacred Site

### History and Origins

Miyoshi Shrine's history began in 1878 (Meiji 11). Settlers from Akita Prefecture enshrined a divided spirit from their homeland's guardian deity, Taiheizan Miyoshi Shrine.

At the time, Hokkaido's development was extremely challenging. Harsh cold, untamed land, unfamiliar environment—amid these hardships, the deity brought from their homeland became their spiritual support. The powerful divine virtue of Miyoshi-no-Okami, "victory over any difficulty," became a great spiritual pillar for those challenging the frontier.

In 1899 (Meiji 32), the shrine relocated to its current location. Since then, it has walked alongside Sapporo's development, becoming one of the city's representative shrines, affectionately known as "Sankichi-san."

Miyoshi-no-Okami is a mountain deity from Akita Prefecture's Mount Taihei. Worshipped as a strong and competitive deity with courage to face difficulties, the divine virtue of "strength in competitive situations" has earned deep faith from students, athletes, and business professionals.

### Architecture and Natural Features

Miyoshi Shrine occupies approximately 4,300 square meters of grounds while being located near Odori Park in Sapporo's business district. Though surrounded by buildings, the grounds retain abundant greenery, serving as an urban oasis.

The shrine buildings preserve Meiji-era architectural style with a dignified appearance. The worship hall, rebuilt in 1951 (Showa 26), features the practical, sturdy construction characteristic of Hokkaido shrines.

Within the grounds stands a large Ezo Itaya maple tree over 100 years old, displaying beautiful autumn colors each fall. There's also a wishing stone called "Sankichi no Ishi," where it's said wishes come true if you place your hand on the stone while making a wish.

Beside the main hall, "Shusse Inari Shrine" is also enshrined, drawing many visitors seeking blessings for business prosperity and career advancement.

### What Makes This Spot Special

What sets Miyoshi Shrine apart is its divine virtue specialized in "victory fortune."

Miyoshi-no-Okami is also called the "competitive deity," and visitors never cease coming before crucial competitions. It's known that professional baseball players and J-League players secretly visit for prayers.

Additionally, the "Miyoshi Shrine Grand Festival" held every May 15 is a seasonal tradition heralding summer's arrival in Sapporo. Portable shrine processions and food stalls draw many worshippers.

Its excellent accessibility in the city center—where you can drop by during work breaks—is another major attraction. As an "urban power spot," it has earned deep faith from busy business professionals.
